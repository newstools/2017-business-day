Singapore &mdash; Oil prices rose on Thursday, driven up by a weakening dollar, but gains were capped by plentiful supplies and inventories despite an effort by oil cartel Opec and other producers to cut output and prop up the market.Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were trading at $55.59 a barrel at 3.13am GMT, up 51c, or 0.93%, from their last close.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.22 a barrel, up 47c, or 0.89 %. Traders said that the increase was largely down to a weakening dollar, which has lost 3.9% in value since its January peak. Since oil is traded in dollars, a cheaper greenback makes fuel purchases less costly for countries using other currencies, potentially spurring demand.However, oil price gains were capped by data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) which showed a 2.84-million barrels increase in commercial crude inventories to 488.3-million barrels, which add to a 6.3% rise in US oil production since the middle of last year to 8.96-million barrels a day."EIA estimates that crude oil and other liquids inventories grew by 2-million barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by an increase in production and a significant, but seasonal, drop in consumption," the agency said.Rising US inventories and output are countering efforts by Opec and other producers, including Russia, to cut supply by a almost 1.8-million barrels a day during the first half of 2017 in an effort to end a global glut.Key customers in Asia are also being spared any significant cuts as producers fear losing market share to competitors."The recent agreement among Opec and non-Opec members for oil exports reduction will not impact our commitments and oil exports to Japan since we have highly strategic relationships between the two great nations," said Aabed Al-Saadoun, deputy minister for company affairs at Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s energy, industry and mineral resources ministry.Reuters
