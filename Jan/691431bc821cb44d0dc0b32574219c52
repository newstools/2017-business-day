The JSE’s 10 largest resources groups, whose index has gained 4% so far this week, are likely to continue their rally on Wednesday, judging by BHP Billiton’s 3% surge in Sydney ahead of the JSE’s opening. BHP said in a production update it had benefited from 2016’s iron ore price rise by producing a record 118-million tonnes in the second half of 2016. Iron ore prices gained 28% last year. The Reserve Bank kept interest rates steady on Tuesday, as expected, which helped the JSE’s general retail index gain 1.3% on Tuesday. The rand was trading at R13.38/$, R14.36/€ and R16.74/£ on Wednesday, relatively unchanged from Tuesday night. Asian stock exchanges on Wednesday morning took their cue from Wall Street where the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices closed at fresh record highs on Tuesday. US stocks were bolstered by better than expected results from chemicals group DuPont, among others. TransCanada, backer of the Keystone XL pipeline, and Energy Transfer, the driving force of the Dakota Access Pipeline, each rose about 3.5% after US President Donald Trump signed executive orders to pave the way for both projects.
