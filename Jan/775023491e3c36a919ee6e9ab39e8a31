Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga put a brave face on the Class of 2016 matric results&sbquo; but she woke up on Friday to a dose of harsh reality.Readers of respected weekly magazine The Economist were greeted by a headline that read: "SA has one of the world&rsquo;s worst education systems: Why it is bottom of the class"."In a league table of education systems drawn up in 2015 by the OECD club of mainly rich countries&sbquo; SA ranks 75th out of 76&sbquo;" the article reports."In November the latest Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (Timss)&sbquo; a quadrennial test sat by 580&sbquo;000 pupils in 57 countries&sbquo; had SA at or near the bottom of its various rankings&sbquo; though its scores had improved since 2011. Its children are behind those in poorer parts of the continent."A shocking 27% of pupils who have attended school for six years cannot read&sbquo; compared with 4% in Tanzania and 19% in Zimbabwe."After five years of school about half cannot work out that 24 divided by three is eight. Only 37% of children starting school go on to pass the matriculation exam; just 4% earn a degree."The Economist says few countries spend so much on education to so little effect. And it points the finger of blame at the South African Democratic Teachers&rsquo; Union (Sadtu)&sbquo; quoting from a report published in May which found widespread corruption in teacher appointments."The government has done little in response. Perhaps this is unsurprising; all six of the senior civil servants running education are Sadtu members&sbquo;" it says.It says there are rays of hope in the shape of low-cost private schools run by companies such as Spark and Future Nation&sbquo; as well as the "collaboration schools" pilot in the Western Cape&sbquo; funded by the state but run by independent operators.TMG Digital/The Times
