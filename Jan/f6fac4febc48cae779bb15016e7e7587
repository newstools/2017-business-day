Former president Kgalema Motlanthe says he is not keen on contesting the ANC&rsquo;s election at the end of 2017."I think it&rsquo;s a bad idea to recycle leaders," he told PowerFM&rsquo;s JJ Tabane. "I think I can make a better contribution in continuing to conduct political education classes."This followed a report in the City Press where Motlanthe was named as one of seven dark horses in the race for ANC president.According to the report, he was considered a compromise candidate as well as someone who could bring hope for many in the ANC and the country.Those said to be endorsing him included some of the party elders.However, Motlanthe on Monday dismissed this and urged those who were thinking of nominating him from not doing so. "They mustn&rsquo;t even think about it, it is a bad idea."Motlanthe spoke about whether he would support Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa&rsquo;s taking over the reins of the ANC, on the principle that the second in charge should succeed the president."If you are a national leader and you go out to the general membership to canvass for whomsoever or yourself, what do you say to these members? What do you tell them? As I said earlier on, elections are meant to strengthen our organisation because it is a free expression of the will of the members."The former president also spoke about how leaders needed to lead by example."To have discipline in an organisation, leaders must lead by example and they must be consistent. By that we mean no is no to everybody and not selectively. Once you become selective about it you encouraging ill-discipline," he said.He also denied that he was part of any campaign in support of President Jacob Zuma in the run-up to the 2007 Polokwane conference.&nbsp;
