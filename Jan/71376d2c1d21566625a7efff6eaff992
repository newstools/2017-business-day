The Vaal Dam&rsquo;s water level has risen for a 10th consecutive week, the City of Johannesburg reported, but asked residents to persist with water-saving measures.The city tweeted on Wednesday that the dam&rsquo;s water level had risen to 44.36% on January 2 &mdash; up from 42.12% on December 26.However, on Thursday morning it retweeted a tweet from Trevor Balzer of the Department of Water and Sanitation, noting that in the past 24-hours it had dipped again, to 44.22%, as "abstraction &amp; evaporation" exceeded inflow. "#Savewater NS," he tweeted.Last week&sbquo; it was reported that the level of the Vaal Dam was likely to increase for the 10th week running as rains in Gauteng replaced a heat wave.The increase was helped by overcast&sbquo; cool and wet weather in Gauteng last week.Thunderstorms were expected to arrive in the province by Friday and continue until Tuesday.TMG Digital
