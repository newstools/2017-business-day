The odometer effect of the Dow Jones Industrial index finally clocking 20,000 points on Wednesday cheered markets on Thursday morning. Wall Street was boosted by several corporations releasing December quarter results that beat analysts’ expectations. These included Boeing which rose 4.24% to a record $167.36 after reporting its first profit in a decade. Frankfurt’s DAX 30 index closed 1.8% higher, boosted by Deutsche Bank rising 5.75%. The Euro Stoxx 50 rose 1.4%, but a stronger rand against the euro on Wednesday limited the gain of Deutsche Bank’s exchange-traded fund which tracks it to 0.23%, giving it a closing price of R47.36. The rand was slightly weaker on Thursday morning, trading at R13.25/$, R14.26/€ and R16.78/£. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index was 1.6% higher, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was 1.4% higher and Sydney’s S&P/ASX 200 was 0.4% higher ahead of the JSE’s opening on Thursday.
