The JSE opened weaker on Tuesday ahead of British prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit speech, while retailers were under pressure following a disappointing sales update from Mr Price. Early speculation was that May would set out a 12-point plan for Brexit that would not involve a "partial" membership of the EU which left Britain "half-in, half-out". Instead she was expected to confirm that Britain would leave the single market and customs union after Brexit.
