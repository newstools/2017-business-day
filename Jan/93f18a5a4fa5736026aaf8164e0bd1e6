The general agricultural outlook at the end of 2016 is much better than a year ago, especially as far as the production of maize and other summer crops are concerned. Grazing was restored in areas that received good rains. However, some regions did not receive any rainfall &mdash; but hope remains that adequate rain will fall for the whole country.The improved outlook can be directly attributed to the positive change in the climate. However, indications are that the weather will not be the biggest threat to food security in 2017.The biggest threat, unfortunately, is the government, with its unaffordable and devastating political and economic policies.These are largely responsible for virtually no economic growth over the past year, an eventual inevitable downgrading of the sovereign and credit rating of the country, unprecedented mismanagement of taxpayers&rsquo; money, an unsuccessful land reform policy and rampant corruption.The government&rsquo;s crippling transformation policy for SA, as a developing country, will further transform the country during 2017 into an underdeveloped country, as in the rest of Africa, with just as much degeneration, famine and poverty.The government clearly turned its back on agriculture in 2016, not only as far as the commercial production of food was concerned but also with regard to the development and establishment of emerging farmers.Commercial agriculture has not received any drought aid after the worst drought in decades, while the utilisation of the assistance given to emerging producers can be regarded as highly suspicious.More than half the drought aid budgeted in the finance minister&rsquo;s medium-term expenditure framework in October was channelled to a government department that has no involvement in drought assistance for emerging farmers. There should be no doubt that the government will again walk away from agriculture in 2017.The government s drastic interference in the economy with new legislation and the review of almost all legislation instituted since 1994 that has failed to achieve the required objectives of poverty alleviation, unemployment and inequality will bring new challenges and pose serious threats to agriculture in 2017.This is especially so when this legislation relates to the equal distribution of wealth, land reform, water use and security of tenure.The revision of this legislation could have been more beneficial to the country if it had focused instead on how to create economic growth for the country.However, it is mainly aimed at trying to keep the governing party in power at the expense of development and prosperity for the country and its people.Most of the radical economic transformation initiatives the government offers its supporters is simply a hijacking of the state by the corrupt ANC elite and their cronies.The operation of market forces will once again be rejected by the government and will result in further serious threats to the financial survival of farmers, mainly because the government doesn&rsquo;t understand how economic growth is driven and created in the first place.Another concern is that food security can only be sustainable if production is profitable, which is also a prerequisite in all other industries in the economy.The prospects of agriculture will not improve in 2017 if the government, and specifically the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, doesn&rsquo;t get serious about the sustainable commercial production of food and fails to take decisive steps to promote and protect it against unfair foreign competition and natural disasters.The time has come for organised agriculture to stand firm against the government&rsquo;s political onslaught with a common vision for profitable and sustainable agriculture.The latest political onslaught against capitalism and the continued attempt to establish communism in the country should not be underestimated. It will eventually deprive the economy of a profit motive and rob the country of economic development and potential for prosperity. In such a scenario, any positive outlook for economic growth will disappear, while the general welfare that still exists will be further dissipated.&bull; Brink is an independent agricultural economist
