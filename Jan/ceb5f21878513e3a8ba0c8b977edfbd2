South Africans living within the boundaries of former homelands under traditional leaders and who do not wish to participate in traditional courts will have the option to opt out under the latest version of the traditional courts bill. The government set up a reference group to look into the bill as previous versions were met with opposition from civil rights groups and eight of the country’s nine provincial legislatures. The bill was approved by the Cabinet in December 2016, but its contents have been kept under wraps. Earlier versions were criticised for allowing traditional leaders too much power, disadvantaging women in former homelands and creating a parallel system inconsistent with the Constitution. Deputy Justice Minister John Jefferey said in Pretoria the latest draft took criticism into account and mandates were in line with the Constitution. "The bill enjoins the traditional leaders to uphold the Bill of Rights. We have taken every effort to address the various concerns relating to the role of women, the right to opt out and in and concerns of entrenching colonial systems," he said. The traditional courts would not provide for legal representation by attorneys, but allows for appeals against ruling at the high court. "The bill would be on its way to Parliament’s presiding officer within a week, he said.
