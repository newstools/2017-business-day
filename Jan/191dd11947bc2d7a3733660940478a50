Port-Gentil &mdash; Seven-time champions Egypt face Ghana here on Wednesday looking for the result that will see them join their opponents in qualifying for the Africa Cup of Nations quarterfinals.The Pharaohs need only draw the game, which kicks off at 9pm SA time, to be certain of progressing to the last eight, although if Mali fail to beat Uganda they will be through anyway.Meanwhile, a win for Hector Cuper&rsquo;s side would allow them to leapfrog the already-qualified Black Stars and advance as group winners. That might not be what they want, however &mdash; the group winners will remain in Port-Gentil for the quarterfinals while the runners-up must up sticks to Oyem in the north of the country.An awful pitch in Port-Gentil has had an adverse impact on the quality of the football played there and heavy rain in the city since the weekend will only add to the problem. "Everyone wants to play in the other city. No one wants to play in this stadium," Egypt&rsquo;s Ahmed Elmohamady said."But for us we need to win, we want to win the group. It&rsquo;s about getting the points, it&rsquo;s not about the stadium."While Egypt have a doubt over fullback Mohamed Abdel-Shafi and 44-year-old Essam El Hadary remains their only fit goalkeeper, Ghana coach Avram Grant may be tempted to rest some first-choice players.AFP
