Petrochemical giant Sasol expects first-half headline earnings per share (HEPS) to drop by up to 44%, dented by a stronger rand and the effect of industrial action at its Secunda mining operations. In its trading update for the six months to December, the blue-chip company said a stronger rand resulted in translation losses of about R1.3bn compared with translation gains of R2.6bn in the year-earlier period. The effect of industrial action at the Secunda mining operations in the review period resulted in a 16% decrease in mining production volumes and higher one-off costs to ensure a continuous supply of coal to Secunda synfuels operations. The additional net cost associated with the industrial action is estimated at about R1bn, or R1.06 per share. "Overall, Sasol delivered a strong business performance across most of the value chain," the company said in a statement on Thursday. Secunda synfuels’ production volumes were up 1%, with Eurasian operations increasing production volumes by 8% due to stronger product demand. Natref’s production volumes were down 7%, mainly due to planned shutdowns during the period under review. Normalised sales volumes were up 11% for the base chemicals business and 2% for the performance chemicals business due to stronger demand, higher chemical margins and improved plant stability. The stock price dropped nearly 3% to R409.31 in early morning trade on the JSE, valuing the company at R267.5bn.
