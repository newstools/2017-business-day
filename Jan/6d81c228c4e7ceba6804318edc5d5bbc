Lungi Ngidi has bowled his way into SA&rsquo;s squad for the first of three one-day internationals against Sri Lanka.Durban-born Titans fast bowler Ngidi made his international debut in the current T20 series against the Lankans and has not struggled to look at home at the highest level.He struck twice in four balls at Centurion on Friday and claimed 4/19 at the Wanderers on Sunday&sbquo; making him the leading wicket-taker in the series. Ngidi also has the lowest average and the best economy rate among bowlers who have sent down at least three overs in the rubber.Or&sbquo; as SA&rsquo;s T20 captain&sbquo; Farhaan Behardien&sbquo; said after Sunday&rsquo;s game: "I think a superstar is born: he seems to thrive in the limelight."I don&rsquo;t want to put too much pressure on him &mdash; he&rsquo;s only 20 years old &mdash; but if he keeps his head he&rsquo;ll have a long career."He bowled out of his skin; he bowled with good pace and good bounce even on a slowish wicket."He&rsquo;s been the standout bowler in two T20 Challenge finals and in his first T20 internationals. If managed properly there&rsquo;s every chance he&rsquo;ll play every format for SA."Ngidi dismissed the Dolphins&rsquo; Kevin Pietersen in the one over he bowled in the 2015 franchise T20 final&sbquo; and removed the Warriors&rsquo; Colin Ingram and Colin Ackermann in the 2016 edition of the same match.Tall and rawboned and blessed with a fast bowler&rsquo;s presence&sbquo; he has claimed 21 wickets &mdash; among them two five-wicket hauls &mdash; at 23.80 in his seven first-class games."Ngidi has been rewarded for his excellent form in the current T20 series and we are keen to see how he goes in the 50-over format&sbquo;" selection convener Linda Zondi said."He has not only impressed with the wickets he has taken and the skills he has displayed but with the energy and intensity he has brought to his game as well."Chris Morris&sbquo; who has been out with a knee problem since June&sbquo; is back in the mix for the one-dayers.But Dale Steyn and Morn&eacute; Morkel are not because of lingering shoulder and back problems. Other casualties from the squad that thrashed Australia 5-0 in October were Aaron Phangiso&sbquo; Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw. Left-arm wrist spinner Tabraiz Shamsi has been preferred to the left-arm orthodox Phangiso.The series is key to SA&rsquo;s preparations for the Champions Trophy in June.TMG Digital
