Wildfires tearing across Somerset West in the Western Cape have damaged one of the country&rsquo;s oldest and most prestigious wine farms.Parts of Vergelegen, Anglo American&rsquo;s 300-year-old farm, were scorched by fires fanned by strong winds.The farm&rsquo;s CEO, Don Tooth, said 40% of the property had been burnt and much of the fynbos conservation area &mdash; which makes up two-thirds of the farm &mdash; had been ravaged by the fires, which were still raging on Wednesday afternoon.Cape Town fire and rescue services spokesman Theo Lane said 120 firefighters were being assisted by crews from Working on Fire and CapeNature. He said 22 vehicles&sbquo; three helicopters and two fixed-wing aircraft had been dispatched in an attempt to douse the inferno.Seven residential properties including the four-star Bezweni Lodge whose main building had been destroyed, had been damaged, he said.Tooth said much of the fynbos that had been burnt was still very young. "It s taken us about 12 years to get where we are in weeding out the alien vegetation. Obviously, when a fire runs through, it germinates alien seeds as well as fynbos seeds and we have to go back in there and weed by hand to get rid of any alien vegetation that comes up again, which is hugely labour intensive."Willem Adriaan van der Stel, son of the governor of the Cape of Good Hope, was granted the farm, about 50km southeast of Cape Town, in 1700. London-based diversified mining company Anglo American bought Vergelegen in 1987."The fire has not damaged buildings, but has damaged some of the land on the farm," Pranill Ramchander, head of corporate communications for Anglo American SA, said.There had been no injuries and the company did not have any confirmed information on what caused the fire, he said.According to Vergelegen s website, the estate has earned more than 200 awards since the production of its first wine in 1992. These included the Chateau Pichon Longueville Trophy and two awards in the "best Bordeaux blend" category at the International Wine and Spirits Competition.Wines of SA spokeswoman Maryna Strachan said the wine and wine tourism industry employed 289,000 workers and was an important player in the tourism industry of the Western Cape and SA.She said while wine farms were vulnerable to damage from fires, it was difficult to determine the extent or cost of the damage without knowing the farm s output."It really depends on which part of the estate was burnt down. Different vineyards provide different yields of grapes and you can get vineyards with four tonnes of grapes and others where you can get one tonne," she said.The authorities had mobilised units and volunteers quickly to assist in fighting the fires, Strachan said."It s a very difficult thing to manage. The authorities are doing what they can to prevent and fight these fires."In terms of prevention, education is key. If you drive on the N2 and see someone in front of you throwing a cigarette out of a moving car, that could be the start of a huge fire," she said.With Bloomberg
