Melbourne — Roger Federer made a winning return to competitive tennis on Monday after six months out of the game, thrilling a packed Rod Laver Arena as he beat qualifier Juergen Melzer 7-5 3-6 6-2 6-2 to reach the Australian Open second round. The 35-year-old Swiss had to battle hard throughout the two-hour, six minute contest, and only really eased clear of his dogged opponent when the Austrian tired in the final set. British world number one Andy Murray also claimed a hard-fought first-round win, over Illya Marchenko, to open his Australian Open campaign. The Scot, who is bidding for his first Australian Open title after losing five finals, prevailed 7-5, 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 in 2hr 47min and will next play Russian qualifier Andrey Rublev. Fourth seed and 2014 champion Stan Wawrinka suffered a huge scare against Slovak Martin Klizan but the Swiss three-times grand slam champion battled through to win 4-6 6-4 7-5 4-6 6-4 on Margaret Court Arena. Japan’s big hope, Kei Nishikori, survived a gruelling five-set examination in the first round to advance in scorching conditions. Fifth-seeded Nishikori came through a dogfight with 48th-ranked Russian Andrey Kuznetsov to win 5-7, 6-1, 6-4, 6-7 (6/8), 6-2 in 3hr 34min and maintain his unbeaten record in five-set matches in Melbourne. It was Nishikori’s fourth five-set win at the Australian Open, and set him up for a second-round encounter with Frenchman Jeremy Chardy. "It wasn’t easy, especially mentally and I should have finished it in four sets," Nishikori said. Spain’s Nicolas Almagro denied suggestions of a money-grab after he lasted just 23 minutes before retiring. Almagro threw in the towel with a calf injury at 4-0 down in the first set against France’s Jeremy Chardy, but walked away with a A$50,000 ($37,400) cheque as a first-round loser. AFP
