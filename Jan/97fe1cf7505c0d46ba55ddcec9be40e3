"Weakness" in the Gauteng and North West regions of the EFF will mean early provincial people&rsquo;s assemblies to elect new leaders.That is according to spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi&sbquo; who said on Monday that the two provinces, along with KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape, had been due to hold the elective gatherings this year.But the party&rsquo;s central command team "has taken a decision that due to the weakness of their provincial command teams&sbquo; Gauteng and the North West must go for early provincial people&rsquo;s assemblies"."Guidelines towards all these assemblies have been adopted and shall be published on all communication platforms of the EFF&sbquo; including deadlines&sbquo;" he said.Ndlozi said that the party s third national plenum which was held at the weekend expressed that "we shall not only vote with the opposition but we shall also take government"."Our objective is to reach an agreement that we take municipalities without co-governing; the DA and other parties must allow us to lead government in municipalities as we have allowed them to do so in municipalities and metros like Tshwane."He said that the party was "proud of the expanded mandate given by the people" in last year s local government elections and would "fight against corruption starting from our own ranks to the highest helms of the state; anyone found guilty of corruption shall be mentioned publicly; particularly councillors MPs and MPLs [members of the provincial legislature]".Ndlozi took aim at moonlighting councillors "keeping their previous jobs so that they earn as councillors whilst also earning as employees of other institutions"."An investigation in this regard is under way and stern actions shall be taken against those councillors found double-dipping. It is EFF policy that councillors should work on [a] full-time basis for their communities."TMG Digital
