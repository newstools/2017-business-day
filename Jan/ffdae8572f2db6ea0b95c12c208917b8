The portfolio committee on police is consulting Parliament&rsquo;s legal office on how to deal with the Claassen Board of Inquiry report into suspended police commissioner Riah Phiyega&rsquo;s fitness to hold office because the document is classified.Last year, news reports claimed the inquiry had found Phiyega was not fit for office and recommended her dismissal.On Wednesday, committee chairman Francois Beukman said the report was referred to the committee towards the end of 2016.National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete confirmed through Parliament&rsquo;s announcements, tablings and committee report on Wednesday that the institution had received the report after President Jacob Zuma studied and considered it.Mbete said the report would be referred to the portfolio committee on police.Beukman said: "One of the issues is that the report is classified as confidential. There are certain considerations to be made and I have asked staff to give me advice on the matter and I am receiving oral or written advice."He said rule 189 of Parliament stated that all documents officially before a committee were open to the public unless they were classified.Classified documents can be disclosed by resolution of a committee, the speaker or National Assembly.He said the next scheduled committee meeting was in early February, but it could meet before then to discuss the issue.Beukman said the committee would study, consider and note the report s contents."[In terms of the] South African Police Service Act, [reports are] given to us for noting. The president has his prerogative," he said."The reference to the committee allows us to take note of and discuss matters affecting the portfolio. There is no decision-making power with the committee as far as the report is concerned," he said.Police Minister Nathi Nhleko s spokesman, Sandile Ngidi, said he could not confirm if Nhleko had seen the report.Other police committee members said they had not seen the report.DA MP Zakhele Mbhele said he would inquire about the report s progress in terms of reaching the committee.
