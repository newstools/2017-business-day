The paper and packing sector is worried that the Department of Environmental Affairs is considering introducing a waste management levy on the industry.Packaging SA, a nonprofit organisation that represents the paper and packaging industry, said about 3.5-million tonnes of paper and packaging was consumed each year in SA. A total of 57% of that was voluntarily collected for recycling.Packaging SA executive director Charles Muller said: "This is significant and compares favourably with first-world countries. The other 43% which goes to landfill (or is discarded) contributes less than 2% of the overall waste of around 110-million tonnes per annum."A national pricing strategy for waste management, within which waste management charges will be set, is being implemented by the Department of Environmental Affairs.The department has noted that waste services are underpriced, discouraging waste generators and holders from reducing waste generation, as well as its re-use, recycling and recovery. In addition, the current pricing framework encourages landfill use, which is considered the cheapest waste disposal method by industry.However, the government wants to minimise the amount of waste going to landfills.The waste information baseline study conducted by the department in 2011 showed that about 108-million tonnes of waste were generated in SA, 97-million tonnes of which ended up in landfills. Only 10% of the waste generated in SA was recycled in 2011.The department has asked the paper and packaging, and electrical, electronic equipment and lighting industries to prepare and submit industry waste-management plans for approval.Muller said packaging "is an integral part of protecting, preserving and containing food &mdash; society can ill-afford unnecessary interference in its supply".He said cost increases, such as a waste management levy, will be passed on to consumers and, as a large part of packaging was used in basic foodstuffs, lower-income groups would probably suffer the most."Policy makers seem to be looking to the wrong industry and the incorrect measures to resolve the problem [waste]," Muller said.The packaging industry was not in good shape and more costs would exacerbate this and, possibly, result in job losses, Muller said. Some companies had either closed, or shut down parts of their business in the past year, resulting in retrenchments.Muller also said revenue collected through a waste levy would not be ring-fenced for recycling or waste management, and could be diverted to other spending priorities such as education, healthcare and infrastructure.Department spokesperson Albi Modise said it had not yet discussed the levy with the sector because final plans had not been approved. It was not the department s intention to hurt the sector, he said."To the contrary, it is envisaged that more jobs will be created in this sector in waste recycling opportunities and enterprise development also focusing on small, medium and micro-sized enterprises, co-operatives and waste pickers. Industry representatives are welcome to raise their concerns with the department," Modise said.
