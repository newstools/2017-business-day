Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Saturday called for South Africans to take a stand in 2017&sbquo; saying they could not afford to be apolitical or sideline spectators as too much was at stake.In a New Year message&sbquo; he said 2016 had been difficult and often frustrating&sbquo; but with the new year came the opportunity to map a new course."This is the time to make a decision that will shape 2017. We are not helpless bystanders witnessing the downward spiral of the economy&sbquo; politics and social cohesion. We are participants&sbquo; with the power to influence what happens next."With the state of our nation&sbquo; not a single citizen can step back and claim that there is nothing they can do. It is only through a collective effort that we will put South Africa back on track towards fulfilling the promises of democracy."We cannot afford to be apolitical&sbquo; neither can we afford ignorance. We need to educate ourselves on what is happening&sbquo; who is driving it&sbquo; and whether it is good for our country. We need to ask questions&sbquo; and demand answers. We need to get involved&sbquo;" Buthelezi asserted."In 2017&sbquo; let us set aside our prejudices and preconceived ideas&sbquo; and really examine South Africa&rsquo;s politics. Are all our political parties what they claim to be? How much is mere talk&sbquo; and how much is true? If we were to empower any one party&sbquo; where would that lead?"This is the time to make a decision. If you are not yet politically active&sbquo; I encourage you to examine the options and take a stand. Because in 2017 there will be no place for side-line critics and spectators. There is too much at stake&sbquo;" the IFP leader added.TMG Digital
