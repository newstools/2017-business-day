London — Hull City midfielder Ryan Mason has been talking in hospital about the incident that left him with a fractured skull, the Premier League club said. The 25-year-old Mason suffered the injury when he accidentally clashed heads with Chelsea’s Gary Cahill in the 14th minute of Hull’s 2-0 loss to the Premier League leaders at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Mason was subsequently taken to the nearby St Mary’s Hospital in west London and underwent surgery. He was visited by Hull captain Michael Dawson and several club officials on Monday. A Hull statement read: "Ryan has been visited this morning at St Mary’s Hospital by club captain Michael Dawson, club doctor Mark Waller, head of medical Rob Price and club secretary Matt Wild. Ryan has been speaking of the incident yesterday [Sunday] and will continue to be monitored at the hospital over the coming days." Cahill, Chelsea captain John Terry and assistant manager Steve Holland all visited Mason on Sunday. Following the collision between Cahill and Mason, medical staff from both clubs sprinted out to attend to the two players, with referee Neil Swarbrick halting play for close to 10 minutes as they each received on-field treatment. Central defender Cahill returned to his feet and scored Chelsea’s second goal, a header, in the 2-0 victory but Mason left the field on a stretcher while receiving oxygen treatment. Several hours after the final whistle, a Hull statement confirmed that Mason had sustained a skull fracture. Clubs and players from across England and beyond sent messages of support for Mason, among them former Manchester United and Chelsea striker Radamel Falcao, who tweeted: "My thoughts and pray for Ryan Mason. Get well soon!" Gareth Bale, who played with Mason at Tottenham Hotspur, tweeted: "Get well soon Mase!! Thoughts are with you and your family, stay strong!!!" AFP
