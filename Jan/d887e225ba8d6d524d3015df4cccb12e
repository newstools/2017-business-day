SA is rated slightly less corrupt&sbquo; according to the latest corruption index&sbquo; but it could have fared better had it not been for the State of Capture report.SA&rsquo;s score on Transparency International&rsquo;s Corruption Perceptions index has improved slightly&sbquo; moving one place up on the scoring table from 44 in 2015 to 45 in 2016.The index ranked 176 countries during 2016 and noted that SA&rsquo;s score shifted three places from 61 to 64&sbquo; which is an improvement. The score refers to the perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of 0-100&sbquo; where 0 is perceived as highly corrupt and a 100 is perceived as very clean.Corruption Watch executive director David Lewis said it was good news that the country was improving on the annual corruption ranking&sbquo; but it was still ranked among other countries deemed to have serious corruption problems.Lewis said SA s improved position on the corruption index was as a result of the intensity of opposition to public corruption."The outrage expressed by civil society organisations ordinary members of the public and the independent media has galvanised a range of other individuals and institutions into action." he said.SA comfortably outstripped its Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and SA) partners. Brazil China and India all scored 40 and ranked 79 on the index while Russia lagged far behind at 29 ranking 131 out of 176.Lewis said South Africans should be particularly concerned at Russia s performance."This is the country that is strongly rumoured to be the government s favoured partner in the proposed nuclear energy deal. Public procurement of this scale with a country as riven by corruption as Russia is guaranteed to import further corruption on a grand scale into this country."Six sub-Saharan African countries fared better than SA. Botswana once again topped the African charts followed by Cape Verde Mauritius Rwanda Namibia and S o Tom and Principe.TMG Digital
