The Department of International Relations and Co-operation (Dirco) has described Solly Msimanga&rsquo;s recent Taipei trip as "highly regrettable"&sbquo; saying it was undertaken against its advice.Dirco spokesperson Clayson Monyela said on Monday that the Tshwane mayor&rsquo;s sojourn&sbquo; which saw him receive the freedom of the city&sbquo; was in breach of SA&rsquo;s foreign policy: "the One China Policy"."Taiwan is not recognised as a sovereign state by SA and the UN&sbquo;" he said."SA maintains a liaison office in Taipei as do the Taiwanese in Pretoria&sbquo;" Monyela said&sbquo; adding that these do not "enjoy the status of an embassy"&sbquo; and exist "to facilitate people-to-people contact"."It has no political mandate and therefore interaction between political office bearers is not allowed."Representatives of any sphere of government must ensure that their engagements with international entities are aligned to existing mechanisms and programmes, and that such relations are co-ordinated in a manner that advances SA&rsquo;s foreign policy and national interests."Monyela did not say if any action would be taken against Msimanga.On Tuesday the ANC called on Dirco to "confiscate all official and diplomatic passports from officials who are found to be willfully undermining our foreign policy".However, Centre for Constitutional Rights director Phephelaphi Dube questioned whether this was the correct way forward&sbquo; telling Radio 702 that "the government is not in position to take simply away one&rsquo;s passport".She said the issue "raises quite interesting questions on intergovernmental relations and co-operative governance&sbquo; because the Constitution makes it clear that "different tiers of government "can make their own policies and make their own rules ... in pursuing their own development strategy".The "bottom line is that the Constitution does allow a certain measure of independence" to different tiers of government, Dube said.The DA defended Msimanga&rsquo;s trip&sbquo; saying: "The reality is that their baseless attacks stem from their unwillingness to accept that they have lost control of many municipalities across SA."The DA reminded the ANC "that neither the ANC nor the national government it runs can dictate who DA Mayors meet with in order to obtain job-creating investment&sbquo; and that such international trips are allowed".The party also said Tshwane was part of a twin city arrangement with Taipei, signed by the previous ANC administration.The DA said the ANC&rsquo;s comments amounted to a "hypocritical attack"&sbquo; and DA trade and industry spokesman Dean MacPherson tweeted details of a 2014 trip to Taiwan undertaken by Trade and Industries Minister Rob Davies.TMG Digital
