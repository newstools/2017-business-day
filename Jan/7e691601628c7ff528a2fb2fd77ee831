The South African Football Association (Safa) should be prepared to pay in the region of R50m a year if they are to hire former England coach Roy Hodgson as the new Bafana Bafana mentor.If the rumour mill is to be believed&sbquo; Hodgson has become the latest name to be linked to the job vacated by the sacked Ephraim "Shakes" Mashaba.But it is not clear if Hodgson&sbquo; whose name has curiously appeared out of nowhere as one of the candidates for the Bafana job&sbquo; would be interested in taking a salary cut.Mashaba was paid R500,000 a month, while the well-travelled Hodgson was the best-paid manager at the 2016 Euro Championship earning a whopping &pound;3.5m a year.His salary put him ahead of the &pound;3.15m earned by Antonio Conte of Italy and the &pound;2.7m earned by Turkey&rsquo;s Fatih Terim.Mashaba was sacked in December with a year left on his contract&sbquo; which was to run until the end of the World Cup in Russia in July 2018.His dismissal followed a disciplinary hearing that found him guilty of gross misconduct&sbquo; insubordination and bringing Safa into disrepute.Last week&sbquo; Carlos Queiroz said he would be interested in returning to the Bafana hot seat if his current employers&sbquo; the Iran FA&sbquo; accepted his resignation."At the moment&sbquo; as you can understand&sbquo; I have ethical duties and obligations with my present contract and I am not in a position to make comments about that in a public way&sbquo;" he said."But if SA&sbquo; or any other country&sbquo; remembers your name and trusts your name as a person to coach the national team&sbquo; for a coach, it&rsquo;s always an honour and something really very special."You are coaching the flag and the nation and the expectations and the dreams of one entire country."Locally&sbquo; Pitso Mosimane, coach of PSL champions Mamelodi Sundowns and recently crowned the 2016 Caf coach of the year&sbquo; insisted that he was out of contention for the vacant position.But his boss Patrice Motsepe made things interesting a day after the comments, when he said he would consider it his "patriotic duty" to allow the in-demand mentor to ascend to national-team level if he wanted the job.TMG Digital
