Access to education‚ migration patterns and improving pupil retention are among the issues the Department of Basic Education will be discussing during its three-day lekgotla. The lekgotla, which started on Monday, is a strategic planning exercise for the education sector to identify areas it needs to tackle to strengthen the plans it had worked on in 2016. Access to education was one of the factors the department had to consider, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said. "That’s where the migration patterns for Gauteng and Western Cape are an issue. "It is your equity: to see how we are doing in terms of poor learners‚ rural learners. That is one of the things we are monitoring to see if we are closing the gap between the poor and disadvantaged learners‚ particularly African learners because they are the most disadvantaged," she said. The biggest problem in 2016 was "the high repetition rate in grades 10 and 11". "That is why we deliberately took the risk of saying schools must support kids not to repeat grade 10 and 11 in big numbers because … the repetition rates also affect retentions."
