US President Donald Trump’s termination of the Trans-Pacific Partnership sent Wall Street and European stock exchanges down on Monday, but was shrugged off by Asian stock exchanges on Tuesday morning. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was 0.31% higher, Shanghai gained 0.1 and Sydney’s S&P/ASX 200 was 0.74% stronger ahead of the JSE’s opening on Tuesday. But Tokyo stocks continued to suffer from the dollar’s slide, with the Topix index down 0.36% and the Nikkei 225 index down 0.27%. Trump’s rush to torpedo the Pacific Ocean trade pact saw the S&P 500 fall 0.27% and Nasdaq 0.04% on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial index, which was within a hair’s breadth of cracking the 20,000 point barrier before Trump’s inauguration, fell a further 0.14% to 19,799.85 points. The Euro Stoxx 50 fell 0.8% after Trump’s first Monday in office. The weakening dollar limited the drop in Deutsche Bank’s exchange-traded fund that tracks it on the JSE to 0.63%, taking it to R47.53. The rand continued its gains against other currencies on Tuesday morning, trading at about R13.46/$, R14.48/€ and R16.84/£ . Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago will announced the vote of the monetary policy committee (MPC) which he chairs at 3pm on Tuesday. Along with most economists, Investec Bank’s Kamilla Kaplan said in a research note on Monday she expects the committee to hold its repo rate at 7%. South African commercial banks define their prime rate as 3.5 percentage points added to the central bank’s repo rate. "Although the December consumer price index (CPI) outcome surprised to the upside at 6.8%, CPI inflation is still expected to return to the 3% – 6 % target range on a sustainable basis from this year, as the effects of supply side shocks dissipate," she said. One reason the MPC is unlikely to raise interest rates is the rand has appreciated by 4.3% against a basket of foreign currencies since its November meeting. The Reserve Bank is likely to maintain that meaningful demand led inflation will remain weak as "consumers are expected to remain under pressure for some time. Household credit extension contracted by 3.9% in real terms, in the January to November 2016 period and consumer confidence remains depressed, Kaplan said.
