Perth &mdash; Roger Federer&rsquo;s comeback from injury struck its first hurdle on Wednesday when he was beaten by teenager Alexander Zverev at the mixed teams Hopman Cup in Perth, but he remained upbeat.In one of the highest-quality singles matches seen yet in the 29-year history of the event, Federer showed plenty of the class that has won him a record 17 Grand Slams, but could not quite hold off the bold 19-year-old German.Despite the result, Switzerland kept their hopes of reaching Saturday&rsquo;s final alive with a 2-1 win over Germany &mdash; Belinda Bencic beating Andrea Petkovic in the women&rsquo;s singles and then teaming up with Federer to win the deciding mixed doubles.The men&rsquo;s singles was a classic battle between the old and the new, with Federer left to rue his failure to serve out the first set when leading 5-3.In the end, two booming first serves from Zverev, the first teenager to make the top 20 since Novak Djokovic in 2006, closed out the match in front of a record crowd of 13,785. He took the match, ultimately decided by three tie-breakers, 7-6 (7/1) 6-7 (4/7) 7-6 (7/4) in two hours and 30 minutes.Federer was upbeat despite his defeat to a player he believes will be a star for the next decade. "Who really cares ... it was good to play for two-and-a-half hours," he said. "Sasha [Zverev] can serve big and showed what he can do, but I was happy how I hung around and I had some really good moments."As long as I am injury-free and feeling good."It was only the 35-year-old s second match since a six-month lay-off due to knee and back injuries the first his win over England s Dan Evans on Monday. But Federer who is out of the top 10 for the first time since late 2002 said he was on the right track for the upcoming Australian Open."I am very happy, I have played five good sets so far," he said. "I am very pleased, practice has gone great, the matches have been a lot of fun and I am playing good tennis."Federer lamented his inability to serve out the first set and a subsequent poor tie-breaker.The veteran made a shaky start to the tie-breaker with uncharacteristic successive double faults, and the teenager pounced on the opportunity to claim the first set.The second set saw both players holding serve easily, with Federer barely challenged on serve until Zverev threatened in the 12th game, when leading 6-5. At 30-all, Zverev lobbed over Federer at the net and had the ball dropped in instead of just floating long it would have been match point.The pair went to another tie-breaker and this time it was Federer that took the honours to level the match and set up a thrilling final set.Bencic beat Petkovic 6-3 6-4 to level the tie, before the Swiss won the Fast Four mixed doubles, 4-1 4-2, to stay unbeaten after two ties.Federer and Bencic will face the French pairing of Richard Gasquet and Kristina Mladenovic on Friday, with the winner advancing to the final.Earlier in the day, Gasquet and Mladenovic overcame extreme heat to sweep Great Britain 3-0 to also notch their second win for the week.AFP
