Mzwanele Manyi&rsquo;s contention that passing the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) Amendment Bill will mean that the "ANC will be broke" shows that the party "is funded on ill-gotten gains"&sbquo; the EFF said.EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi also said the "attempt by Manyi to hijack the ... bill to try and solve the Guptas&rsquo; problems of closed bank accounts is a clear demonstration of desperation".Manyi&sbquo; speaking as president of the Progressive Professionals Forum&sbquo; on Wednesday vowed to take President Jacob Zuma to court if he signed the bill into law&sbquo; telling Parliament the legislation would scare off backers and donors and when the 2019 national elections come around&sbquo; the ANC will be "as broke as hell".Zuma returned the bill to Parliament last year&sbquo; citing concerns that a clause allowing for searches without a warrant was unconstitutional because it limited the right to privacy.Ndlozi said on Friday the EFF "believes that the Fica bill is a step in the right direction in the fight against massive financial crimes and illicit financial flows that define SA"."For a very long time&sbquo; SA has been a playground of financial criminals who are involved in money laundering and many other instances of illicit financial flows without consequences&sbquo;" he added.Ndlozi said Manyi had contended that "the bill criminalises black people"&sbquo; but the "majority of companies&sbquo; particularly multinational corporations across all sectors&sbquo; that are party to financial crimes are not owned by black people&sbquo; but are owned by a group of [a] few white males"."To further say that&sbquo; due to Fica bill&sbquo; the ANC will be broke&sbquo; Manyi is unconsciously confirming a view that the ANC is funded on ill-gotten gains and people are stealing from the poor to fund ANC billion-rand campaigns and secret propaganda war rooms&sbquo;" he said.The latter was a reference to reports that emerged this week that alleged the ANC had set up a covert campaign to boost itself and degrade opposition parties. The ANC distanced itself from the campaign.Ndlozi took aim at Manyi&rsquo;s support of the politically connected Gupta family&sbquo; saying: "Banks must adhere to the law regardless of the individuals&rsquo; concerns and bring to the attention of the relevant authorities cases where there is reasonable suspicion of financial crimes."Manyi has been critical of the major banks&rsquo; decision to cease doing business with Gupta-owned businesses.Ndlozi also said: "Zuma&rsquo;s concerns about the constitutionality provisions relating to warrant-less searches in the of the bill is unfounded and all legal opinions have found that the concerns are baseless and have no legal standing&sbquo; and that the bill is in fact constitutional."TMG Digital
