Parliament&rsquo;s portfolio committee on communications is meeting on Tuesday "to discuss the process of appointing an interim board of the SABC"&sbquo; the government has said in a statement.The meeting comes after Parliament&rsquo;s ad hoc committee on the SABC board inquiry last week deliberated over a working document, to complete a draft report on its probe into the crisis at the public broadcaster.Among the recommendations of that report was "that the dissolution of the SABC board be expedited and finalised urgently".The last remaining member of the board&sbquo; chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe&sbquo; resigned last year.The Congress of the People&rsquo;s Dennis Bloem said on Monday that "there is no other way of rescuing the SABC other than appointing an apolitical board that will serve all the people of this country and not a political party"."The committee members must put the best interest of the country first and not the interest of their respective political parties&sbquo;" he added.TMG Digital
