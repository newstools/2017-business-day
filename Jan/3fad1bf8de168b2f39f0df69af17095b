The South African bond market was a lot weaker on Monday morning, with the yield on benchmark R186 rising to its highest since in about three weeks.The bond market took direction from a rand that weakened anew amid speculation that President Jacob Zuma was poised to reshuffle his Cabinet, which could include a new finance minister."Political risk came back to the fore with a bang on Friday as rumours of an &lsquo;imminent&rsquo; Cabinet reshuffle hit the headlines and markets began to recall the issues plaguing the rand in 2016," said Wichard Cilliers, a director and head of currency dealing at TreasuryOne.Sunday Times reported at the weekend that former Eskom CE Brian Molefe could replace Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in a reshuffle that is expected to rope in the outgoing AU chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.The yield on the 10-year note was 8.95%, its steepest since January 3, as the rand slipped to R13.5453 to the dollar, from highs of R13.1968 last week. The 10-year note settled at 8.83% on Friday.The weaker rand poses a risk to inflation, which is expected to average 6.2% in 2017, according to the Reserve Bank. The central bank kept the interest rates on hold last week.Besides the political risk factors, investors will watch out for a raft of data due out this week, including local trade data. Trading Economics expects the country to have recorded a trade surplus of R3.5bn in December, swinging from a trade deficit of R1.1bn in November.
