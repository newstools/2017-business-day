President Jacob Zuma has said that the ANC is ready for a woman president in an interview with the SABC's Nguni radio station.This from the story by Penwell Dlamini:&nbsp;&ldquo;It is no longer a discussion in the ANC whether a women can take a high leadership position or not. This discussion has been had before and the party agreed that anyone who is seen to have the qualities to lead the movement&sbquo; there won&rsquo;t be any problem for that person to do so&sbquo;&rdquo; Zuma said.&ldquo;The ANC is ready for that&sbquo; in fact the party has been ready for some time.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;If you look in government&sbquo; women are holding key positions and you can see they are doing a good job&hellip; no one in the ANC is questioning whether a woman can be the president or not.&ldquo;It will depend on the integrity that she possesses and whether members see her fit for the position. We no longer look at whether the person is a woman or man. This is our belief in the ANC.&rdquo;Of course, Zuma's observation is to be welcomed. As is his belief that presidential candidates should be judged on their integrity. Cough. But the&nbsp;timing of his remarks suggests something else.Barely two days ago, the ANC Women's League came out swinging for his former wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, saying it backed her for the ANC presidency.This caused a minor uproar, with the party's secretary general, Gwede Mantashe, desperately trying to put the leadership genie back in the bottle.Zuma's remarks appear to have been timed to boost Dlamini-Zuma's prospects and suggest that he does not have faith in his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa.But don't forget that Zuma has a soft spot for the embattled Speaker, Baleka Mbete, who has shredded her credibility - and that of parliament - in an effort to save him from himself.Zuma's manoeuvres this year will be based on a simple calculation: Will the next ANC president keep me out of jail or not?
