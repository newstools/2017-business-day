Striking workers on Thursday shut down the University of SA&rsquo;s (Unisa) main campus in Muckleneuk&sbquo; Pretoria&sbquo; over a wage dispute. The entrance to the campus was a sea of red as scores of singing and chanting workers in National Education Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) regalia voiced their grievances with management.Nehawu&rsquo;s Sello Bila said the university will not function until its demand for a 10% salary increase is met and a commitment from the university management to deal with its wastage and corruption at the institution is given. He said Nehawu and management deadlocked when management reduced its initial offer of a 6% increase to 4.5% &mdash;"That is arrogance on the part of the university&sbquo; so we returned to our initial demand of 10%."Bila said the institution spent R100m on an IT system to be used for student registration this year, but that the system is not working. "The university also rents buildings&sbquo; though it has buildings of its own&sbquo;" he said.The road leading to the campus is blocked&sbquo; with Tshwane metro police controlling traffic and a police helicopter hovering over the striking workers. Traffic reports on Thursday morning also warned motorists to avoid the Florida and Midrand campuses.TMG Digital
