De Beers reported a strong improvement in its first sale of rough diamonds for the year, realising $720m in what is normally one of its strongest demand period.A year ago, De Beers, an 85%-owned subsidiary of Anglo American, generated $545m from its sales to about 80 handpicked clients called sightholders and through auctions.De Beers sold $5.58bn worth of rough diamonds through its 10 sales events last year."We saw good demand across the majority of our assortment during the first sales cycle of the year, as the industry entered the period when rough diamond demand is traditionally strongest," said De Beers CEO Bruce Cleaver, adding that the gap between the final sale of last year in December and the first of this year bolstered demand.At the start of the sale in Gaborone, the city that hosts the 10 sales events after De Beers relocated its sorting, aggregation and sales business from London, Cleaver had warned of the negative effect on rough diamond sales from India&rsquo;s demonetisation programme to change high-value bank notes in the country."While the reopening of some diamond polishing operations in India saw something of an increase in demand for smaller, lower quality rough diamonds, we maintain a cautious outlook for these categories as the Indian industry continues to adjust to the post-demonetisation environment," he said on Monday.De Beers is the largest rough diamond producer by value and is one of the key business platforms within Anglo American, which is selling bulk-commodity mines in iron ore, coal and nickel.
