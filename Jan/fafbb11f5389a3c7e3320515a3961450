Much to the relief of South African cricket‚ gritty Test opener Dean Elgar will be rejoining English county side Somerset‚ but not as a Kolpak player. Elgar represented the side in 2013 when he was on the fringes of the Test squad but is understood to have turned down a Kolpak contract. This bodes well for Cricket SA‚ who need Elgar as an opener for the two-and-a-half-month tour of England, starting in May. Somerset said Elgar would be released by the time SA play the first of four Tests against England on July 6. TMG Digital
