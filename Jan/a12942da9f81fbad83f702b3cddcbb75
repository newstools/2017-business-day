Next season&rsquo;s proposed T20 competition could be central to the player retention policy being planned in the wake of a rash of high-profile Kolpak signings.The tournament will run independently from the country&rsquo;s other events and is to feature some of global cricket&rsquo;s biggest stars.It could also give pause for thought to South Africans looking to join the exodus to England that in less than a week has claimed Kyle Abbott&sbquo; Rilee Rossouw and David Wiese.Tony Irish&sbquo; the CE of the South African Cricketers&rsquo; Association which&sbquo; with Cricket SA&sbquo; are drafting a plan to keep players in the country&sbquo; said throwing money at the problem would not solve it."It&rsquo;s about security but not just financial security&sbquo;" Irish said on Wednesday. "It&rsquo;s a number of issues including the way players are man-managed. That could be a lot better. It&rsquo;s also a lot about giving players aspiration in the system&sbquo; and I think this global T20 league we are planning is critical to that."To have our own&sbquo; really good T20 event&sbquo; like the Big Bash [in Australia], is very important for the retention of our players."There&rsquo;s a financial element to that. But it&rsquo;s also about aspiration in the system&sbquo; it&rsquo;s about giving the players something that they really want to play in within the system in front of bigger crowds&sbquo; something that&rsquo;s broadcast around the world."Irish&rsquo;s position is complicated by the fact that he is also the executive chairman of the Federation of International Cricketers&rsquo; Associations."It is a bit of a balance because we definitely stand for player opportunity in all the players&rsquo; associations around the world&sbquo;" he said. "But the recognition of the importance of international cricket and the role it plays and trying to make that as strong as possible is still a very big priority for us."Our player base is not just the guys who are able to get opportunities to play around the world&sbquo; whether those are Kolpak opportunities or T20 league opportunities."We act for 250 players here in SA and the players&rsquo; associations around the world represent hundreds of players in their systems."For Titans CEO Jacques Faul&sbquo; who is also a lawyer and a former acting CEO of Cricket SA &sbquo; money was the best motivating factor among the limited options SA had for hanging on to their players."Your first intervention would be limiting the number of Kolpak players [in SA&rsquo;s domestic competitions]&sbquo; although I wonder if that&rsquo;s not challengeable&sbquo;" Faul said."There are only a few ways in which you can retain people. One is contractual&sbquo; so you sign them for the duration of a contract that you can extend."Legally you bind them. But that eventually runs out and players can refuse to sign it."Tackling the problem by abolishing racial quotas &mdash; which cricket&rsquo;s Trumpist right wing blame when a white player signs a Kolpak deal &mdash; "doesn&rsquo;t make sense".But he warned against alienating players who had taken up Kolpak deals from playing in SA.TMG Digital
