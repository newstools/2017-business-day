2017 will be the year of the rescue of the revolution&sbquo; according to Azapo&sbquo; which says 2016 was "downright more painful for the majority of us than we deserved". In a New Year&rsquo;s message it said that history would never "forgive us for handing back our own freedom and liberation on a platter to the colonialists&sbquo; racists and white settler-minority regime"."Of course one must add: with the collusion of the black comprador bourgeoisie under the leadership of the African National Congress and its homeland allies. In short&sbquo; the ANC sold us out and we all colluded and should&sbquo; therefore&sbquo; take collective blame&sbquo;" the black consciousness organisation said.It added that the weight and gravity of corruption and the rot that the so-called national democratic revolution under the "patently corrupt" ANC government exhibited had caused all to pale into insignificance."From state departments&sbquo; to state enterprises&sbquo; to parliamentary committees and formations&sbquo; to ruling party leadership structures&sbquo; to erstwhile respectable comrades and revolutionaries-there is no limit. It&rsquo;s been a national tragedy."From a revolutionary perspective&sbquo; though&sbquo; the year 2016 has been a great year&sbquo; Azapo averred."This year comrade Jacob Zuma found out that South Africa is a constitutional democracy -however deceptive the white western liberal democratic concept is -and not a personal fiefdom"This year impunity was subjected to scrutiny in such a way that the State Enterprises were reminded they are not a law unto themselves and their deployees are not God."This year the SABC Board was finally reminded that party political loyalty&sbquo; especially of non-descript nonentities of no struggle background&sbquo; will not last over against the need for integrity and the commitment to realizing the noble goals of freedom and liberation"This year the truth&sbquo; even in the hands of reactionary forces of the status quo like the Democratic Alliance (DA) and the tongues and throats of populism such as the rest of unhappy masses&sbquo; redefined politics and announced the smell of coffee to the complacent historical forces&sbquo;" Azapo stated.For a considerable while&sbquo; a solitary figure&sbquo; in the person of the public protector&sbquo; advocate Thuli Madonsela&sbquo; had also kept the hopes of the nation alive&sbquo; it added.TMG Digital
