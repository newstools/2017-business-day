Proteas captain Faf du Plessis harbours no grudges against Kyle Abbott but said his decision to take up a Kolpak contract last week messed with the team&rsquo;s preparation for Thursday&rsquo;s third Test against Sri Lanka.Du Plessis equated the mini-turmoil to the "mintgate" saga that developed into a full-blown storm after SA handed Australia an innings defeat in Hobart in December."I&rsquo;ll use the Australian series as an example, where we played amazing cricket and led the series 2-0 and there&rsquo;s other stuff that influences and takes the shine from the performances&sbquo;" Du Plessis said."We respect Kyle&rsquo;s decision and what&rsquo;s left is for us to look forward to the next Test match and build a new bowling unit ."Wayne Parnell will replace Abbott in the match-day 11."Wayne offers something different&sbquo; that being a left-arm seamer. In a perfect world&sbquo; that&rsquo;s the variety you&rsquo;d love to have to Kagiso Rabada&rsquo;s pace and Vernon Philander&rsquo;s relentlessness," he said.TMG Digital
