Stock exchanges trading ahead of the JSE’s opening on Tuesday morning generally took their cue from weaker US and European indices. An exception was London’s FTSE 100 which closed 0.38% higher on Monday, with British shares boosted by the pound’s slump on "hard Brexit" fears. These were sparked by a comment from UK Prime Minister Theresa May indicating she considered barring immigrants to be more important than maintaining access to the EU’s single market. The rand was 0.5% stronger at R16.55/£ ahead of the JSE’s opening on Tuesday as the pound continued its slide. While the weaker pound was good for London stocks measured in their local currency, the JSE’s UK-focused listings suffered. Brait fell 3.38% to R79.52, Capital & Counties 3.31% to R48.15 and Intu 2.67% to R46.23 on Monday. Sasol may benefit on Tuesday from a rally in international oil prices. Brent was 0.56% higher at $55/barrel and West Texas Intermediate 0.46% higher at $52 at 6:52am. Paris’s CAC 40 index closed 0.45% lower and Frankfurt’s DAX 30 index 0.3% lower on Monday. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial index fell 0.38% to 19887 points, again dashing hopes of those waiting for the "odometer effect" of it clocking 20,000 for the first time. The S&P 500 index fell 0.35%, but the Nasdaq index rose 0.19%. Tokyo, which reopened after a public holiday on Monday, took its cue from Wall Street with the Nikkei 225 index down 0.88%.
