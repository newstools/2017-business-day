Consumer inflation moved further outside the Reserve Bank’s 3%-6% target range in December. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 6.8% in December compared with a year earlier, Statistics SA said on Wednesday, from November’s 6.6%. Trading Economic had forecast a 6.8% increase, and the Bloomberg consensus was for a 6.5% rise. The average inflation for 2016 was 6.4%, which is in line with the expectations of the Reserve Bank. The Bank’s outlook for CPI inflation is that it will come back within the 3%-6% target range in 2017 when it is seen slowing to 5.8%, and easing further to 5.5% in 2018. Nedbank said the inflation figures underscored the need for caution before calling the end of the Reserve Bank’s rate hiking cycle. “While our baseline view is that the next move by the Reserve Bank is probably down, we still expect the MPC [monetary policy committee] to remain cautious, leaving rates at current levels for some time, given the downside risks posed to the rand by a volatile domestic landscape and changing global dynamics.” CPI increased by 0.4% between November and December. Food inflation is still running high in SA, due to the lagged effects of a devastating drought of last year, but Nedbank pointed to expectation that SA's next maize crop will be bigger - with Agbiz estimating total production for the 2016-17 season at 11.7-million to 13-million tons, after last season's 7.5-million tons. This could bring food price inflation down, Nedbank said. Food and nonalcoholic beverages inflation was 11.7% year on year in December, picking up slightly from 11.6% in November. The transport component of the CPI increased 5.7% in December from a year ago. The housing and utilities component increased by 1.3 percentage points in November compared to 1.4 percentage points in December while the subindex increased by 5.6% year on year. Rand Merchant Bank’s analyst Gordon Kerr said on Wednesday ahead of the release that most economists forecast the peak in CPI to have been in the fourth quarter of 2016, and a gradual move back downwards into the target band during 2017. Analysts from Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking said on Wednesday, ahead of the release, that SA’s economic growth outlook had improved off a low base in 2016, and was expected to be 1.2% in 2017. They said that if CPI came in as expected below the 6% upper band throughout the year, on lower food inflation, this would provide the Reserve Bank with some impetus for a flatter interest rate profile this year. The Bank's monetary policy committee is meeting next week. The consumer price index was at 124.7 points in December 2016, compared with 116.8 in December 2015.
