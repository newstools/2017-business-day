Bafana Bafana will have to negotiate their way through an Astroturf surface face an artificial pitch that coach Stuart Baxter has described as "not the best" when they take on Cape Verde in a crucial 2018 World Cup qualifier in Praia on Friday night. We take a look at five Bafana players who will be crucial for Baxter in taking the game to the hosts in this must-win encounter. • Thulani Hlatshwayo. The Bafana captain will marshal the heart of the defence with either Eric Mathoho or Morgan Gould and his familiarity with cabbage pitches in Africa with Bidvest Wits and the national team will come in handy. • Bongani Zungu. The artificial Estádio Nacional de Cabo Verde pitch is a far cry from the pristine Portuguese Primeira Liga grounds where he turns out for Vitória Guimarães, but Zungu will have to adapt very quickly if he is to make a meaningful contribution in midfield. • Hlompho Kekana. The Mamelodi Sundowns midfield strongman became accustomed to playing on deplorable pitches on the continent in the Caf Champions League and his experience is going to be priceless in Praia. • Thulani Serero. He is another player in the team who He has been through the rigours of playing on the continent with Bafana and he is experienced enough to be able to handle the pressure. • Tokelo Rantie. Making quick turns and getting a grip on the ground to find accuracy may be difficult on the synthetic pitch, but the Turkish-based attacker‚ who he is expected to lead the attack for Bafana‚ has accumulated enough experience on the continent.
