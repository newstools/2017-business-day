Risk-off sentiment weighed on global equity markets, including the JSE, on Monday, after North Korea conducted its largest-ever nuclear test at the weekend. This prompted investors to pour into safe haven assets, helping to lift gold miners. The near-term direction would hinge on the reaction of the administration of US President Donald Trump to the North Korean nuclear test as well as investors delayed reaction to the lacklustre macroeconomic data out of the US on Friday, Momentum SP Reid Securities analysts said. This had caused another rally in gold. However, emerging-market and other risk-aversion assets had hardly reacted, said Standard Bank trader Warrick Butler. One was reminded of the old "cry wolf" parable, he said. Local data this week include GDP figures for the second quarter on Tuesday, when the Standard Bank purchasing managers index is also due. The focus this week will also be on a spate of earnings reports, including Sanlam and FirstRand on Thursday, although Monday is quiet. The Labor Day holiday in the US could also help subdue trade.

European equity markets were all lower, amid the focus on North Korean tension. Though markets expected no major changes to the European Central Bank’s policy this week, the single currency’s recent strength meant investors would pay close attention to ECB president Mario Draghi’s remarks after the rate-setting meeting on Thursday, Dow Jones Newswires reported. In midmorning trade the CAC 40 was off 0.53%, the DAX 0.67% and the FTSE 100 0.1%.
