The JSE opened lower on Thursday, and looks headed for a dip below 55,000, having closed lower every day this week. Asian markets were mixed and the global risk-averse mood returned, while flat company results from Sanlam and FirstRand added to the bad news. The rand reached R12.67/$ in early morning trade from R12.7887, before weakening marginally. Mining stocks were weaker on the firmer rand and a flat Brent crude price, with the euro making further gains against the dollar ahead of the Central European Bank (ECB) meeting later in the day.
