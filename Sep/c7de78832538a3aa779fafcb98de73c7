There was nothing that Victoria Geoghegan‚ one of Bell Pottinger’s lead partners on the Gupta-owned Oakbay account, could have done on the account without the knowledge of CEO James Henderson‚ former Bell Pottinger chairman Lord Tim Bell says. The PR firm fired Geoghegan in July after finding evidence of a social media campaign that highlighted the issue of economic emancipation in a way that the firm considered to be inappropriate and offensive. Henderson resigned at the weekend, on the eve of the release of a finding into the conduct of Bell Pottinger by the UK’s Public Relations and Communications Association. The firm has been expelled from the association. The DA has alleged that the PR firm worked for the Gupta family and devised a strategy of protest against "white monopoly capital" to allegedly divert attention away from criticism of the Gupta family’s activities and that such action violated The association’s code of conduct. Speaking to Radio 702 on Monday night‚ Bell said he had stepped down in August last year for a number of reasons‚ including the handling of the Oakbay account. Bell said the initial visit to the Gupta family was the total amount of his involvement. He said there was a conflict of interest as it would clash with Bell Pottinger’s other clients‚ including Mediclinic and Investec. "It just did not feel comfortable."
