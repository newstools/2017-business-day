Technology services group EOH expects earnings per share (EPS) and headline earnings per share (HEPS) to rise 10%-20% for the year to July 31. EOH said on Monday that revenue was up 21% from a year earlier — and rose across all the group’s businesses. The company provides ICT services to a range of sectors, including financial services, retail, manufacturing, mining, health and the public sector. EOH’s shares edged up 0.32% to R110.45 at 11.29am on Monday. They have fallen 32.5% so far in 2017, in part in reaction to the unexpected departure of CEO and founder Asher Bohbot. Bohbot was replaced by Zunaid Mayet. There were also allegations of impropriety — which Mayet has vehemently denied, saying lawyers brought in to examine the allegations have found nothing wrong — in the company’s contract with the South African Social Security Agency. EOH said it expected to release its results on September 19.
