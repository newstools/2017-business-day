There are more questions than answers emerging around the alleged foot injury that scuppered Rivaldo Coetzee’s transfer from Ajax Cape Town to Scottish champions Glasgow Celtic. The Celtic physiotherapist‚ who flew to Cape Town to examine the Bafana Bafana centre-back‚ found degeneration in a bone in the right foot of the 20-year-old‚ which led to a decision to call off the £800,000 move. But Ajax have since referred Coetzee to two foot specialists in the Mother City and have been handed a different diagnosis. One doctor said it was a condition that had not caused any problem to Coetzee’s career and would not in future. As a result, Ajax are going to consult one or two more specialists to try to get to the bottom of the condition. "It sounds that it is really not as bad as first thought, but we wait until a definitive diagnosis comes‚" said club director Mich d’Avray on Thursday. "He has played with this for the past two years and really not complained about it at all. Obviously, the player is quite devastated‚ missing out on the chance to go and play overseas ... but we’ll have to wait and see how it all pans out." Coetzee, who made his Bafana debut in 2014 — five days before his 18th birthday — pulled out of the national team squad for the two World Cup qualifiers against Cape Verde as a result and will wear a moon boot over the next weeks to take some pressure off his foot. Ajax’s bad luck in the transfer window continued on Thursday, when they pulled out of a deal to buy Marshall Munetsi from Orlando Pirates. The Zimbabwean midfielder had been on loan at Baroka FC in 2016 and impressed Ajax‚ who had earmarked him for a key midfield role this season. But an MRI scan showed he has a major hip problem and so Ajax pulled out of the deal. They are already angry over belatedly finding out that Morné Nel‚ who they loaned from SuperSport United for the season‚ will need an operation before he is able to play.TimesLIVE
