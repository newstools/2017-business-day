The rand was a little weaker on Monday morning, taking its lead from wobbly global markets. Markets traded cautiously after North Koreaâ€™s latest nuclear test, which it conducted at the weekend, renewing concern about military conflict on the Korea peninsula. The rand is sensitive to shifts in global sentiment that could affect bond and equity flows. The local currency displayed a stronger bias heading into the weekend, touching its best level to the dollar in five weeks on Friday, following disappointing US nonfarm payrolls data. Altogether 156,000 jobs were created in the US economy in August, lower than the expected 182,000, the data showed on Friday. Wages again showed little upward movement, which could lead to slightly higher inflation as average hourly earnings for private-sector workers rose 0.1% from the previous month and 2.5% on an annual basis. The data suggested that the US Federal Reserve could delay raising interest rates. Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at Brown Brothers, said the global liquidity outlook remained supportive for emerging markets, at least for now. Over the past week, foreigners were net buyers of local bonds to the tune of R1.35bn, bringing the total bought so far in 2017 to just more than R56bn. At 8.45am, the rand was at R12.9567 to the dollar from R12.9440, at R15.4073 to the euro from R15.3892 and at R16.7724 to the pound from R16.7840. The euro was at $1.1892 from $1.1885
