The JSE opened lower on Thursday morning, after a technical glitch prevented trading for almost two hours. Global markets were higher, despite a hawkish stance struck by the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday. The Fed announced it would begin reducing its $4.5-trillion balance sheet from October‚ and signalled it would raise interest rates again before the end of the year. Locally, the focus will be on the Reserve Bank monetary policy committee’s rate decision, where it is widely expected to announce a second 25-basis-point cut, after cutting in July for the first time in five years. Morning trade would be about adjusting to the Fed, while afternoon trade would be focused on the Reserve Bank, said Rand Merchant Bank analyst John Cairns.
