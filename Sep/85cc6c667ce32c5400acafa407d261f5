The rand held steady below R13 to the dollar at midday on Monday as the dollar lost ground to the euro in safe-haven trade ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Friday. The market will be watching for any indication when the ECB intended to taper its bond purchase programme as part of its ultra loose monetary policies. The euro has consistently been boosted by this prospect, as well as future interest rate increases in the eurozone. Upbeat manufacturing data released last week has also supported the euro. The euro is currently trading at two-year highs against the greenback. Trading on Monday was subdued on a US Labour Day public holiday with safe-haven assets the favourite asset class amid ongoing tension in the Korean peninsula after North Korea announced it had successfully tested a nuclear bomb. Geopolitical factors are undoubtedly driving market tonality at present, Momentum SP Reid analysts said. "The near-term direction will hinge upon the reaction of President Donald Trump’s administration to the North Korean nuclear test as well as investors delayed reaction to the lacklustre macroeconomic data out of the US on Friday," Momentum SP Reid analysts said. At 11.30am the rand was at R12.9782 to the dollar from R12.944, at R15.4553 to the euro from R15.3892 and at R16.7998 to the pound from R16.784. The euro was at $1.1909 from $1.1885. The local currency broke through R13 to the dollar last week, touching its best level to the dollar in five weeks on Friday, following disappointing US nonfarm payrolls data. Altogether 156,000 jobs were created in the US economy in August, lower than the expected 182,000, the data showed on Friday. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.4% from 4.3%. Wages again showed little upward movement, which could support higher inflation as average hourly earnings for private-sector workers rose 0.1% from the previous month and 2.5% on an annual basis. The data indicated that the US Federal Reserve could delay raising interest rates with the market anticipating a possible hike in December. Consumer inflation in the US has been stable at 1.6% for the past few months, consistently lower than the Fed’s 2% target. © Business Day
