Sindiso Magaqa‚ the former ANC Youth League (ANCYL) secretary-general‚ has died. ANC spokesman in KwaZulu-Natal Mdumiseni Ntuli confirmed Magaqa’s death on Monday night. Magaqa and two other ANC councillors were rushed to hospital in July after they were shot by unknown people at Umzimkhulu in southern KwaZulu-Natal. He has been in hospital since. Ntuli said the ANC had been convinced that Magaqa was on the path to recovery in hospital. EFF leader Julius Malema was among the first to send a message of condolences following the news. Magaqa was the secretary-general of the Youth League until it was disbanded in 2012 after its leadership was found guilty of bringing the ANC into disrepute. While Magaqa was suspended‚ Malema‚ who was ANCYL leader and spokesman Floyd Shivambu were expelled from the party. The ANC sent its condolences to Magaqa’s family. "May they find solace in the knowledge that we painfully share their loss and thank them for having borrowed the ANC and the country this incomparable son of the soil‚" the ANC said in a statement. In a statement‚ the ANC said Magaqa was part of a generation of young people in the ANC who fought tirelessly for the realisation of the vision of economic freedom. "For their commitment to their convictions‚ Comrade Magaqa and his comrades suffered differences with the leadership of the organisation and marginalisation within the structures of the movement‚" the ANC said. The party said Magaqa remained loyal to the ANC‚ eventually returning to the fold. He was deployed as a councillor in the Umzimkhulu Local Municipality. "He understood that his generational mission remained unfulfilled and affirmed his belief in the ANC as the only reliable tool in the hands of the people to drive it. He served with diligence and distinction in the council and as member of the mayoral committee at the time of his passing."
