Orlando Pirates footballer Happy Jele has been arrested for speeding near Sandton at 223km/h in a 120km/h zone early on Monday morning. This was confirmed in a statement by Gauteng’s department of community safety. The statement reads: "The Gauteng traffic police high speed unit arrested Orlando Pirates Soccer player‚ Happy Jele early this morning. The Pirates player was driving a 135i BMW‚ travelling on the M1 near Sandton at an average speed of 223km/h. "When the officers managed to stop him‚ he claimed he was on his way to attend to his sick child. It was later found that the information was untruthful. "Jele was arrested on the spot and taken to Sandton Police Station where he was formally charged with reckless driving and exceeding the prescribed limit of 120km/h. "At the time of release the bail was not determined and he will appear in the Randburg Magistrate Court shortly." "I am disappointed at Happy Jele’s driving behaviour and conduct. Professional players are supposed to be role models and safety ambassadors," said Gauteng MEC for community safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane. TimesLIVE
