South African Revenue Service commissioner Tom Moyane still believes KPMG's report on the "rogue unit" was not flawed, despite the audit firm itselfÂ  scrapping the report and offering to refund SARS for it. Moyane instead was angry over KPMG publicly announcing that the report was dubious and that it was refunding the tax agency on Friday, without consulting SARS. "The report by KPMG is not flawed, in fact it confirms conclusively that there is prima facie evidence of wrongdoing in the organisation ... we don't find the report flawed, in fact it gave us goosebumps," he told journalists on Monday. KPMG had written to SARS ahead of its announcement but had gone public without giving the tax agency an opportunity to respond. He also cast doubt on whether KPMG was withdrawing the entire report. Moyane said SARS would take legal action against KPMG and has reported the firm to Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba so that it can be blacklisted. SARS will also seize any work KPMG is currently performing for the organisation and work it had done in the past 10 years to assess whether it should demand its money back. The tax agency has also reported KPMG to Parliament to investigate the immoral conduct of the audit firm and determine the appropriate action.
