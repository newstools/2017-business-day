South African bonds were mixed in early morning trade on Tuesday in subdued trade as the market awaited second-quarter GDP data, which were due for release later in the morning. A positive growth figure could boost the rand, which would support the bond market. US treasuries firmed from the Labor Day holiday on Monday. Sasfin Fixed Income analyst Alvin Chawasema said the local market "was starved of activity on Monday" when the US markets were closed for the public holiday. "The escalating tensions in the Korean peninsula will continue to drive EM [emerging-market] performance before attention turns to the European Central Bank (ECB) for further guidance on balance sheet normalisation," he said. The ECB is expected to take a cautious view on tapering its inflated balance sheet and possible rate increases. At 9.03am the R186 was bid at 8.510% from 8.505% and the R207 was at 7.165% from 7.180%. The rand was at R12.9619 from R12.9684. The US 10-year bond was bid at 2.1429% from 2.1666%, reflecting the more dovish stance from the US Federal Reserve on the recent subdued consumer inflation data. "While monetary policy considerations were also featuring in investors thought processes, ultimately the likelihood of a rate hike emanating from the Fedâ€™s Federal open market committee had diminished," analysts at Momentum SP Reid analysts said.
