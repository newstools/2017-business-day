Faf du Plessis will captain the national team in all three formats‚ Cricket SA (CSA) said on Monday. Du Plessis‚ already SA’s Test and T20 captain‚ takes over the one-day side from AB de Villiers — who stood down last month. A CSA release said the board had "approved the recommendation of the national selection panel" to install Du Plessis as one-day international skipper. His first engagement as ODI captain will be three matches against Bangladesh next month.
