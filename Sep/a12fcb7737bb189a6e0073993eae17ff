Parliament’s portfolio committee on communications says it will consider public comments during its final deliberations on the selection of a new permanent board for the SABC. For the first time since the dawn of democracy, the public was given an opportunity to comment on the CVs of the 36 shortlisted candidates. MPs began interviewing the candidates on Wednesday for the 12 available positions on the SABC board. Candidates include lawyers, journalists, accountants and all current members of the interim SABC board. The candidates were quizzed on issues relating to the broadcaster including improving its revenue streams, the Broadcasting Act and the challenges faced by the previous board that led to its demise. "Having received a substantial number of comments, we are confident that our interaction with the candidates during interviews will be enriched," said committee chairman Humphrey Maxegwana. The Right2Know Campaign lobbied the committee successfully for it to make public the 36 candidates’ full CVs and has now called for the public comment process to be extended. "The committee should allow the people to own and shape the board of the broadcaster." The candidates’ interviews continue on Friday. phakathib@businesslive.co.za
