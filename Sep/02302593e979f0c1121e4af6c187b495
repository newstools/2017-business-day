The CE of the Public Investment Corporation Dan Matjila on Friday was again subjected to a prolonged grilling by members of the board despite being cleared by an internal audit report into his conduct. This was the third special board meeting in three weeks. Matjila is under pressure from several nonexecutive directors on the board, including chairman Sfiso Buthelezi, who have raised concerns about his conduct. The board said in a statement after the meeting that it “has concluded that the allegations were baseless and that Dr Matjila is cleared of any wrongdoing”. The board again put Matjila under pressure to distance himself from a report in the Sunday Times last weekend, when he said that there were people out to remove him from the board in order to loot the PIC. In its statement the PIC said: “The CEO has denied the statements that have been attributed to him in that article. He completely distances himself from spurious insinuations against the Minister of Finance, Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson of the PIC Board as contained in the article. “The CEO finds the article distasteful as it creates an impression that he is at loggerheads with the PIC shareholder representative, who is the Minister of Finance, the Chairperson of the PIC Board who is the Deputy Minister of Finance, the Deputy Chairperson of the PIC Board and other stakeholders.” The statement also asserted that Buthelezi, his deputy businessman Xolani Mkhwanazi and all other PIC directors were fulfilling “their fiduciary duties ethically, independently and without fear or favour. We, therefore, take exception to any unfounded allegations that any of the directors are captured by certain individuals or are driving a particular agenda”. Earlier in the week Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba held a meeting with the board at which he expressed his displeasure at press reports that reported on divisions in the PIC. He warned PIC directors and executive committee members to stay out of politics.
