The JSE was weaker on Friday morning, as markets digested signals from global central bankers on Thursday, while eyeing North Korea’s possible launch of another ballistic missile this weekend. On Saturday‚ North Korea will observe the anniversary of the 1948 founding, and has generally used the occasion to demonstrate its military capabilities. Senior South Korean officials warned earlier this week they believed North Korea was readying another ballistic missile for launch. Gold and platinum miners gained on Thursday, buoyed by a weaker dollar environment, which tends to favour commodities. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump reiterated that North Korea needed to be reined in, but added that he would prefer a diplomatic solution to the impasse, the Dow Jones Newswires reported. In terms of local data the cupboard is bare on Friday. The European Central Bank (ECB) kept rates unchanged on Thursday, as expected, with president Mario Draghi indicating further details on the unwinding of its balance sheet could be forthcoming in October or December. Some analysts pointed to the weak dollar environment — and a possible dovish stance from the US Federal Reserve — as a reason to expect the euro to track higher against the dollar in coming sessions. The rand usually tracks the euro. The greenback was taking a hammering, dropping to its lowest level in two years, as a result of the barrage of hurricanes, dovish Fed comments that have reduced the expectation of US rate increases and tension on the Korean peninsula, said TreasuryOne dealer Phillip Pearce.
