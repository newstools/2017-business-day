The rand steadied on Tuesday morning, with markets appearing to adopt a wait-and-see attitude to the tension on the Korean peninsula. "The uncertainty now lies with the potential US response. Geopolitical risk often produces a dramatic but short-lived response," said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. In the absence of fresh and concrete developments around North Korea, the focus will later shift to the performance of the local economy in the second quarter. Economists and analysts expect the local economy to have pulled off a better performance in the three months to June, which would mean the country was officially out of the technical recession, defined as two successive quarters of economic contraction. "A positive GDP figure would help the rand ... despite the global risk aversion. My range for today is R12.85/$-R13.00/$," TreasuryOne dealer Phillip Pearce said in a note. Overall economic activity is one of the key variables that rating agencies consider when assessing the countryâ€™s debt rating. The economy is expected to grow at least 2.1% in the second quarter, rebounding from the 0.70% contraction in the first quarter. At 9.32am, the rand was at R12.9581 to the dollar from R12.9684, at R15.4158 to the euro from R15.4281 and at R16.7634 to the pound from R16.7703. The euro was at $1.1898 from $1.1896.
