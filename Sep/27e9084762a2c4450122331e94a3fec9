Cricket SA CE Haroon Lorgat has quit his post with immediate effect after a breakdown in relations with the board, Cricket SA president Chris Nenzani said on Thursday. "We recently tried, on a few occasions, to remedy the situation between Mr Lorgat and the board, but we have not been successful in finding a satisfactory resolution," said Nenzani. "The board unanimously felt that it was in the best interest of the organisation that we agreed to a mutual separation agreement with Mr Lorgat." Nenzani did not go into detail about the breakdown in relations but it has been reported there was concern about Lorgatâ€™s role in setting up the new Global T20 league, due to start in November. Lorgat was appointed CE in 2013, initially on a three-year contract extended until July 2019. Cricket SA vice-president Thabang Moroe will take over as acting CE. A former first-class cricketer, Lorgat was treasurer of the then United Cricket Board of SA and was convener of selectors before being appointed as CE of the International Cricket Council. He held this position from 2008 to 2012. During his tenure at the world body he clashed with the Board of Control for Cricket in India over arrangements for the 2011 Cricket World Cup, which was hosted by India. The Indian board tried to persuade its South African counterpart not to appoint Lorgat and a breakdown in relations led to India threatening to call off a 2013-14 tour of SA. A curtailed tour eventually took place. AFP
