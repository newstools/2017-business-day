In a January letter to the University of Zululand, the foundation admitted that 2016 had been a "challenging" year and it would not be able to meet its financial commitments before the end of the year.The Sunday Times also established that bursary students at North-West University were let down by the foundation, with spokesman Louis Jacobs confirming that last year's fees were finally settled only this year for the about half a dozen bursary holders. It is unclear if and how the 2017 bursary holders were affected. Read the full article in the Sunday Times:Â Broke Jacob Zuma Foundation dumps university students
