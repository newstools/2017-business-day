The rand reversed its earlier losses on Wednesday, just before midday, as the local market turned is attention to local data which would give an indication of economic growth. Statistics SA reported that mining production and sales for the second quarter of 2017 had decreased by 0.8% year on year after it had increased by 3.6% year on year in May. Later in the day, Stats SA will release the second-quarter manufacturing production and sales data. The local currency has been volatile in the past few days as the market made sense of events leading to, and the outcome of the vote of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma, which he survived. On a global scale, currency markets will closely watch developments in the tensions between the US and North Korea. North Korea warned that it would surround its missiles around the US territory of Guam in coming weeks, in response to US President Donald Trump’s threats. Trump said North Korea’s threat of nuclear weapons will be met with "fire and fury". Rand Merchant Bank analyst Isaah Mhlanga said while local markets cooled off from the failed secret vote of no confidence, Trump’s comments set in motion a risk-off trade, leading to global risk-aversion. At 11.30am‚ the rand was at R13.3562 to the dollar from R13.4386‚ at R15.6449 to the euro from R15.8034‚ and at R17.3334 to the pound from R17.4751. The euro was at $1.11715 from $1.1759.
