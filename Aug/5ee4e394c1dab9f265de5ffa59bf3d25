South African bonds were weaker shortly before midday on Thursday, despite the stronger rand, which had reversed from earlier losses to the dollar. The rand, which bonds usually track, has lost most of the gains it had made on Monday afternoon when it was announced that the vote of no confidence would held via secret ballot. The JSE was closed on Wednesday, as international markets balked at rising tension between the US and North Korea. Risk-off sentiment had boosted safe-haven assets, including gold, while the rand remained volatile. The global data calendar had nothing that could potentially excite markets, and geopolitical developments would be monitored, said Rand Merchant Bank analyst Isaah Mhlanga. At 11.30am the R186 was bid at 8.625% from Tuesday’s 8.56% and R207 at 7.41% from 7.33%. The rand was at R13.3562 to the dollar from Wednesday’s R13.4386.
