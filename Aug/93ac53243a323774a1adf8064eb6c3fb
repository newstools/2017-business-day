The National Assembly is to debate a proposal for an early election. The debate will take place on Tuesday next week, the National Assemblyâ€™s programme committee announced on Thursday morning. The DA, which made the call for the dissolution of Parliament and early elections after President Jacob Zuma survived his eighth vote of no confidence earlier in August, welcomed the decision. An unprecedented number of ANC MPs voted against him in the secret ballot. The DA made a request for early elections in terms of section 50 (1) of the Constitution. This section of the Constitution allows for the dissolution of Parliament and stipulates that the president must dissolve the National Assembly if the assembly adopts a resolution to dissolve with a supporting vote of a majority of its members. This call has been rejected, not only by the ANC but by other opposition parties as well. This has kicked off a series of factional tussles in the governing party and its parliamentary caucus that have stopped at least one committee from doing its work. DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said in a statement from the party on Thursday that the drafters of the Constitution had foreseen a need to include a provision to allow for early elections for this very purpose. "The events of August 8 made it clear that our country desperately needs a new beginning," said Steenhuisen. He said the DA would call for all MPs to support the motion as SA could "no longer afford to have that ANC in power any longer".
