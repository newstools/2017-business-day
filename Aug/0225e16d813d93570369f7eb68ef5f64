Amnesty International has urged South African authorities to move forward with prosecutions over the killing by police of 34 people in a single day at Lonminâ€™s Marikana platinum operations five years ago. "The tragedy of the Marikana killings is compounded by the shocking fact that no one responsible for the bloodshed has yet been held accountable," said Shenilla Mohamed, executive director of Amnesty International SA. The organisation has also called for victims and their families to receive adequate compensation. While no one has been prosecuted for the August 16 2012 killings, charges have been filed in a case relating to 10 other deaths that took place in the week ahead of the incident, a National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesman said on Monday. Violence broke out at Marikana after thousands of rock-drill operators went on strike. On August 16 2012, riot police killed 34 people and more than 70 others were injured. President Jacob Zuma appointed a commission of inquiry led by retired judge Ian Farlam to investigate the killings and the deaths of 10 other people in the lead-up to the police shooting. The police used the wrong tactics to disperse the strikers, while the conduct of senior officers during the subsequent inquiry was questionable, Farlam said in his 2015 report. He recommended that the government assess whether the then police commissioner, Riah Phiyega, was fit to remain in her post. Phiyega was suspended in October 2015. Zuma said in December that the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) recommended the prosecutions of police officers for offences including murder, attempted murder and defeating and obstructing justice.
