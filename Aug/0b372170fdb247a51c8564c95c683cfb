Charlotte — Jordan Spieth has the chance to replace Tiger Woods as the youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam at this week’s PGA Championship but the 24-year-old American is focused on doing the little things right and hoping the rest takes care of itself. The final Major of the year arrives just three weeks after the British Open, leaving players barely enough time to catch their breath before teeing up in a championship that once billed itself as "Glory’s Last Shot". After Spieth’s epic victory at Royal Birkdale, he will now try to complete the Major set by winning the giant Wanamaker Trophy at Quail Hollow. With a solid tie for 13th at the Bridgestone Invitational in Akron on Sunday, Spieth showed that while he was not quite firing on all cylinders he had not lost his form. He went fishing in the mountains of Montana for a week after capturing the Claret Jug and while he was pleased with the way he played on his return he acknowledged there was more to do, particularly dialling in his putting and making sure his alignment was inch perfect. "Today I struck the ball beautifully," he said late on Sunday. "I drove the ball a lot better than I had been, which is really what I was looking for as we head into Quail Hollow, which is such a tough driving golf course. "I came back from a week off and struggled a little bit with my alignment but each day felt a  little bit more comfortable and now we’ve got a few more days of preparation for the PGA." Spieth said his putting had not been up to his usual lofty standards recently, apart from that late purple patch at the British Open where he was five-under from the 14th to 17th. Co-favourite Rory McIlroy will arrive with a spring in his step at Quail Hollow, where he has won twice on the PGA Tour, including his maiden victory in 2010 when he shot a 10-under 62 in the final round.
