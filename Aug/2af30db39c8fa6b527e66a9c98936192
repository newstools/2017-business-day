The EFF has urged the government of Malawi to reverse an order banning party leader Julius Malema after an aborted trip to the country. Reports said Malema and Zambian opposition leader Saviour Chishimba were expected to attend a conference organised by an anticorruption group in Malawi. But the EFF said the government’s decision was based on dishonesty and rumours. In its call on the government on Thursday night to reverse its decision, the EFF said neither Malema nor the EFF had ever "done anything anywhere to deserve being refused entry" into the country. The EFF said the banning was based on "dishonest and misleading remarks" by Chishimba, who had "created an impression that he will be hosting the leader of the EFF in Malawi". The party said it had not planned for Malema to visit at anyone’s invitation. "There has never been any communication between Chishimba and the EFF or its president about any such visit or the political conditions in Malawi‚" the EFF said. "We‚ therefore‚ call on the government of Malawi to reverse this decision as it is based on wrong information to start with. "It cannot be that the leader of the EFF can be banned based on false rumours‚ even if these are by those who are hostile to the government of the day in Malawi. "Africa is the home of the EFF‚ and so is Malawi. CIC Julius Malema must never be treated as a threat to his own continent‚ in particular to the people and the government of Malawi."
