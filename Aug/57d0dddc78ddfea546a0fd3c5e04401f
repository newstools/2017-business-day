The rand traded off the day’s worst level against a weaker dollar on Friday just before midday, as markets waited for the release of US non-farm payrolls data later in the day. Expectations are that the payrolls figure for July will slow down from the 222,000 recorded in June to 180,000. Rand Merchant Bank analyst Michelle Wohlberg said while the market expected the print to slow down, the "real thing to watch" would be the average hourly earnings, which would indicate what was happening with inflationary pressure in the US, and how it would affect the Fed’s next meeting. This afternoon’s non-farm payroll data has put pressure on other emerging-market currencies, which were mostly flat against the dollar. Should payrolls deviate from expectations, the dollar could strengthen slightly and will create higher expectations of a hawkish Federal Reserve. At 11.31am, the rand was at R13.3522 the dollar from R13.4011, at R15.8634 to the euro from R15.9065 and at R17.5639 to the pound from R17.6071. The euro was at $1.1881 from $1.1869.
