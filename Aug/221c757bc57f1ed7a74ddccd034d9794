Budapest — Sebastian Vettel will enjoy Formula One’s August break as championship leader but the Ferrari driver knows the job is only half done and it will not get any easier in the months ahead. But the German, a four-time world champion with Red Bull, is unlikely to spend the holiday fretting about his future. Out of contract at the end of the season, Vettel’s comments after winning in Hungary on Sunday did not sound like those of a man expecting anything other than a continued spell at Maranello. Reports in Italy have already suggested that Ferrari, the sport’s most successful and glamorous team, will confirm both Vettel and Finnish teammate Kimi Raikkonen at their home Italian Grand Prix in September. Vettel has now won four of 11 races this season, making 2017 his best season with Ferrari, and has led the championship from day one in Australia. He is 14 points clear of Lewis Hamilton, who shared the lead with him briefly after China in April but gave Vettel three extra points on Sunday by handing back third place to teammate Valtteri Bottas.
