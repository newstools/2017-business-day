Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown said she would expect an explanation from Eskom in two days on the state of its relationship with Trillian Capital Holdings, but said she did not know that the power utility had misled her on the matter. She was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a briefing to Parliament’s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) on Wednesday, before stepping out to a attend a Cabinet meeting. Earlier this week Eskom admitted it had lied about payments of R1.5bn made to the Gupta-linked company. The power utility will now have to set the record straight with the minister by Thursday afternoon. When asked about the inconsistency in Eskom's explanations, Brown said she was not aware that Eskom had misled the country on the matter when the parastatal said there was nothing untoward about the payment. Eskom admitted on Monday morning that it had lied to Business Day and other media in June when it said that a review by Oliver Wyman, a management consultancy headquartered in New York, had found the payments to be above board.
