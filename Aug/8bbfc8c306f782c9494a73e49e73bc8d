Despite reports that Zimbabwe’s first lady Grace Mugabe had left the country on Tuesday following allegations of assault‚ TimesLIVE has learnt from two independent sources that she is still in the country. Mugabe has been accused of assaulting 20-year-old Gabriella Engels with an extension cord at a luxury hotel in Sandton‚ Johannesburg‚ on Sunday night‚ where Mugabe’s two sons were thought to be staying. Engels on Monday opened a case of assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm at the Sandton police station‚ and Mugabe was widely expected to appear in court on Tuesday. But by the close of business she had not been arrested nor handed herself over to the police. Police spokesman Brig Vishnu Naidoo said on Tuesday that the police had been "negotiating" with the legal representatives of the suspect in the assault case. He declined to name the suspect. On Wednesday‚ Naidoo said no arrests had been made but "we will see as the morning and the day unfolds. We are focused on finalising the investigation." He told AFP on Wednesday that police knew where Mugabe was. Acting police commissioner Lt-Gen Lesetja Mothiba told Parliament's portfolio committee on police on Wednesday's that her lawyers had agreed to co-operate with police. However, he could not comment on her whereabouts, except to say that if she did indeed intend co-operating with police, she should still be in the country. Mothiba said National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams was present with Mugabe's lawyers when the commitment to co-operate with the police was made. Mugabe's lawyers presented themselves to plead diplomatic immunity on her behalf, he said. If Mugabe was no longer in SA, he said, she would be compromising not only the work of the police on the case, but also that of her own lawyers.
