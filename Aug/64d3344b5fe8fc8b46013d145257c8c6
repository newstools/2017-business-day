South Africans’ bad debts have improved compared with a year ago, but the picture for the year to date is mixed. Statistics SA reported on Thursday that the number of civil summonses issued for debt was down 16.7% in June from a year earlier, at 48,169. The number of civil judgments for debt has also fallen from a year earlier — down 10.5% to 21,954 in June 2017. However, the amount of money involved in those judgments is higher, up 1.6% at R350.6m. And, while Stats SA’s graphs show the long-term trend for both summonses and judgments is downward, in both cases the picture for the year to date has seen falls and spikes — and judgments appear to be turning higher. The high indebtedness of South African households has long acted as a damper on consumer spending, but household indebtedness has been easing, Investec economist Kamilla Kaplan pointed out in a note earlier this week. The ratio of household debt to disposable income was at 73.2% in the first quarter of this year, she said, from about 80% in 2013. In addition, National Credit Regulator data show credit application in the first quarter fell 9.49% from the previous quarter and 4.65% from a year earlier, she said. The Stats SA data show that most of the civil debt cases — summonses and judgments — are individuals rather than businesses. This is a longstanding trend. In June, 42,188 of the 48,169 summonses for debt went to private persons, while 19,738 of the 21,954 judgments for debt were against individuals.
