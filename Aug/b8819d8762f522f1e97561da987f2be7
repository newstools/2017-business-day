Bidvest Wits captain Thulani "Tyson" Hlatshwayo says there is no truth in speculation he is joining Orlando Pirates. Hlatshwayo‚ who grew up supporting the Buccaneers‚ has been linked with a move to Parktown‚ but he has put an end to those rumours. "I’ve heard the rumours and to be honest‚ no one has come to me from Pirates. I’m still contracted to Wits‚" the Soweto-born defender said. He has two years left on his contract with the Clever Boys. The 27-year-old insisted his focus was on helping his team defend their MTN8 crown and the league. "The league is about to start now and I will appreciate [it] if we focus on that. "I’m staying with Bidvest Wits‚" Hlatshwayo said. Wits play Golden Arrows in the MTN8 quarterfinals at Bidvest Stadium on Friday (8pm) and he said they were raring to go. "Everyone will come out guns blazing at us." Wits had to focus on repeating their success of the previous season, he said. TimesLIVE
