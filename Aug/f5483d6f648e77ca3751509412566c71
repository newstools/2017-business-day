Belgrade — Manchester United were well placed to challenge for the Premier League and Champions League titles amid strong competition on both fronts, the club’s Serbia midfielder, Nemanja Matic, said on Monday. The 29-year-old blended seamlessly into Jose Mourinho’s side after joining from Chelsea during the close season and made an immediate impact in their opening three league wins. "At the age of 29 I am an experienced player and at that stage of my career I shouldn’t need too much time to adapt," Matic said as the Serbian national team gathered on Monday for World Cup qualifiers against Moldova and Ireland. "I knew many of United’s players from before as I’ve played against them quite a few times, so I had a pretty good idea what I was walking into. "The team helped me adapt quickly; they treated me like one of their own in the dressing-room from the first day. We’ve made a pretty good start in the league, but it’s a long season and we will see how it goes. "Winning the Premier League title will be a tough task because there are five or six realistic contenders," said Matic. "But we all know that Manchester United are expected to win every game. As far as the Champions League is concerned, we’ve had a favourable draw and we are hopeful of still being in the competition in the latter stages." Reuters
