There are moves to reinstate charges against former finance minister Pravin Gordhan over the alleged bugging of National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) offices in 2007, a project dubbed "Sunday Evenings". While the Hawks would not confirm the status of their investigation on Wednesday, Business Day understands that both former finance minister Trevor Manuel and his deputy, Jabu Moleketi, have been subpoenaed. Manuel was out of the country but confirmed via SMS that he had been subpoenaed. Moleketi could not be reached for comment. It is also understood from senior sources that the investigation is at an advanced stage, with two South African Revenue Service (SARS) officials having turned state witness. Project Sunday Evenings features prominently in the KPMG report  commissioned by SARS into the alleged "rogue unit". This is said to have involved the bugging of the NPA offices  by two SARS officials, who  were part of its high-risk investigation unit and who were apparently moonlighting.
