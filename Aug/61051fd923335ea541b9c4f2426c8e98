The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has denied reports that it will not accept leaked e-mails as evidence against President Jacob Zuma’s allies in its probe of alleged corruption and state capture. The City Press reported on Sunday that two senior prosecutors as well as a senior official at the elite police unit the Hawks said they did not think the e-mails would be admitted as evidence as they believe they were stolen. "His report is sensational and an attempt to discredit and malign the NPA and its leadership. We intend to take up the matter with the press watchdog," the NPA said in a statement. "The NPA, in particular the prosecution team giving guidance to the Hawks investigators, has never raised any issues relating to legality in respect of the leaked e-mails with the management." City Press journalist Abram Mashego said he stood by his story. "I can tell you my sources within the NPA are very reliable. They have no reason to lie to me. They have been accurate on a number of occasions," Mashego told Radio 702. In June, media began reporting on more than 100,000 documents and e-mails leaked from inside the business empire of the Gupta family, which is close to Zuma. The Guptas have said the leaks are fake, and Zuma and the Guptas have denied wrongdoing. A family spokesman last month said the allegations were false and part of a "blatantly political campaign". The stories based on the leaked e-mails have drawn several international firms into a scandal that has prompted senior politicians to call for Zuma’s resignation. Reuters
