Bengaluru — Gold prices inched up early on Wednesday after two days of losses, with investors awaiting minutes from the US Federal Reserve’s last meeting in July for clues on the pace of potential interest rate increases. Spot gold inched 0.1% higher to $1,272.81/oz by 3.57am GMT, after falling for two straight days. US gold futures for December delivery was down 0.1% at $1,278.50/oz. "I think we’re starting to just see further opportunistic buying," said ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes. "There’s potentially a little bit of rebound into the end of the week though obviously most focus will be on the [Federal open market committee meeting] minutes this afternoon. Any indication about a potential rate hike could derail that safe-haven buying." Minutes of the meeting are due later in the day. Higher interest rates could boost the dollar, making commodities priced in the greenback more expensive for holders of other currencies. The dollar edged lower in early Asian trading on Wednesday, while Asian stocks rose as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un delayed a decision on firing missiles towards Guam. "We probably saw some of that selling that came in as tension eased between North Korea and the US become a bit overdone. Certainly, the underlying issues that started emerging last week are far from evaporated," ANZ’s Hynes said. Spot gold could test a resistance at $1,278/oz, a break above which could lead to a gain to the next resistance at $1,286, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said. Among other precious metals, silver and platinum were up about 0.3% at $16.64/oz and $959.65/oz, respectively. Palladium rose 0.3% to $888.50 after touching its lowest in over a week earlier in the session. Reuters
