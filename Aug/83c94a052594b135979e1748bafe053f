Bengaluru — Gold rose on Wednesday as safe-haven demand was buoyed by the expectation that geopolitical tension could persist, although further gains were capped as the dollar recovered slightly amid the perception of a brief lull in tension surrounding North Korea. "A lot of people are still seeing gold as a safe haven because we have not heard much in terms of reactions of the different countries to North Korea’s action," said Brian Lan, MD at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore. Spot gold rose 0.3% to $1,313.10/oz at 4.03am GMT, but was off a more than nine-month peak hit on Tuesday at $1325.94. US gold futures were little changed at $1,318.30/oz. "Do we think that the geopolitical issue will intensify? No, we don’t, but we cannot rule it out either," said Dominic Schnider at UBS Wealth Management in Hong Kong. "Looking at how things are spiralling, the risk is that these tensions linger on." The dollar pulled away on Wednesday from the previous session’s four-and-a-half-month low against the yen as investors’ concerns over North Korea eased for now. Geopolitical risks can boost demand for safe-haven assets such as gold, considered a good store of value during volatility in other markets. North Korea said on Wednesday it had conducted a test of an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) to counter US and South Korean military drills. The US would not allow North Korea’s lawlessness to continue and it was time for Pyongyang to recognise the "danger they are putting themselves in" as the world is united against them, US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said on Tuesday. "An overbought RSI [Relative Strength index] and some heavy data days from the US into Friday’s nonfarm payrolls may slow the charge for now, but overall the technical picture [for gold] remains constructive," said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at Oanda. Spot gold was expected to retest a resistance level at $1,326/oz, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), rose 0.3% on Tuesday. In other precious metals, silver rose 0.6% to $17.45/oz, but was trading below its more than two-month peak of $17.67 touched on Tuesday. Platinum climbed 0.2% to $994.30/oz. In the previous session, the metal hit its highest since early March at $1,006.30. Palladium was mostly unchanged at $942.99/oz. It hit its highest in more than 16 years in the previous session at $949.10/oz. Reuters
