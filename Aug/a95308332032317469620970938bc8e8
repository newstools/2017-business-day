The rand was weaker against the dollar on Thursday before midday while other emerging-market currencies were mostly flat, as market focus turned toward US non-farm payrolls data, due to be released on Friday. The rand, like most of its emerging-market peer currencies, faces local issues which add to factors weakening the currency. The rand was 0.54% weaker against the greenback and continues to experience downward pressure after ratings agency Moody’s, on Monday, said it was concerned about SA’s economic growth trajectory and political uncertainty. The Turkish lira was 0.31% weaker against the dollar after inflation rose more than expected, to 10.3%. Dow Jones Newswires reported that the inflation in Turkey was expected to drop by 0.04%, bringing the annual inflation rate to 9.58%, according to a survey of economists by The Wall Street Journal. Other currencies, such as India’s rupee and Argentine’s peso were flat against the dollar, with the rouble facing the pressure of the US sanctions imposed on Russia. US non-farm payroll data will be used to determine the monetary policy stance the Federal Reserve will take towards raising interest rates. An improved number could see another rate increase before the end of the year. Increasing interest rates in the US could put pressure on emerging-market economies and currencies that are reliant on foreign direct investment to drive economic growth.
