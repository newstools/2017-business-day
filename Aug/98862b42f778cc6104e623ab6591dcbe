The rand steadied on Tuesday morning as calm prevailed on the global markets, following last week’s volatility. With geopolitical risks around North Korea and the US easing, attention is likely to return to market fundamentals that had taken a backseat. The dollar was a little perkier on the global markets after New York Federal Reserve president William Dudley hinted at a possible interest rate increase later in the 2017. Dudley’s comments came on the heels of lower than expected inflation figures on Friday, which cast doubt on further US rate increases. Higher rates in the US have the potential to divert portfolio flows from emerging markets, which would put pressure on the rand. SA has attracted nearly R50bn in net bond inflows so far in 2017, helping to cushion the rand against the local political shocks, including the firing of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan. At 9.07am‚ the rand was at R13.3381 to dollar‚ from R13.3273‚ at R15.6470 to the euro from R15.7017 and at R17.2760 to the pound from R17.2766. The euro was at $1.1731 from $1.1783.
