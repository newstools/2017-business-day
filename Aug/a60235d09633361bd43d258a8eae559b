South African bonds were slightly weaker on Friday morning, even as the rand was marginally firmer, following the terrorist attack in Barcelona and amid concern about US President Donald Trump being able to deliver on his economic promises. The rand, which bonds usually track, reached its best level of R13.1278/$ on Thursday afternoon, but then weakened later in the day. Sasfin Securities analysts said the rand shed its gains on Thursday mainly as a result of safe-haven buying as reports of a terrorist attack in Spain emerged. A van drove into pedestrians in Barcelona, killing at least 13 people and injuring many others. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack. Trump’s decision to disband his business advisory councils on Wednesday‚ after business executives protested against his failure to condemn racism, has created tension in his administration, which is expected to have a negative effect on investor sentiment. At 9.01am the R186 bond was bid at 8.5100% from Thursday’s 8.495% and the R207 at 7.2800% from 7.265%. The rand was at R13.2233 to the dollar from R13.2597.
