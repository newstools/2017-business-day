Eskom’s board is meeting on Tuesday to address “all matters pertaining to McKinsey and other topical issues”, the utility said on Tuesday morning. Acting chairman Zethembe Khoza said the main aim of the meeting was to “stem the negative coverage”. The board is under pressure from the Department of Public Enterprises and Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown. The department tweeted on Tuesday: "In June Minister Brown asked Eskom's Board to clarify its business with Trillian. Today she instructed the Board to table a report in 48hrs." The board's meeting comes a day after Eskom admitted it lied about payments made to Gupta-linked financial advisory firm Trillian and global consultancy McKinsey.  The admission — an about-turn from previous statements made to the media — led to speculation about who was behind the misinformation. Eskom sources claimed chief financial officer Anoj Singh was implicated. Neither Singh nor Eskom legal head Suzanne Daniels would comment on Monday on those allegations. The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse said on Tuesday that it had laid charges of corruption and financial misconduct against Singh. It said it did this at the Randburg police station on Monday. Outa said its legal head, advocate Stefanie Fick, submitted an affidavit that drew on advocate Geoff Budlender’s investigation for former Trillian chairman Tokyo Sexwale, and evidence contained in the GuptaLeaks e-mails. Eskom’s statement on Tuesday said the board would not “tolerate any proven wrongdoing by whoever is involved”. It said the board would issue a statement after the meeting.
