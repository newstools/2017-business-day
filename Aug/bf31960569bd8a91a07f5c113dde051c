Harare — Zimbabwe’s first lady Grace Mugabe, accused of assaulting Gabriella Engels, returned home on Sunday, Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) reported. SA granted her diplomatic immunity, allowing her to return to Harare and avoid prosecution for the alleged assault of the 20-year-old model, a security source said on Friday. Mugabe returned “in the early hours of this morning” along with her husband, Robert Mugabe, when he flew back from a summit of the Southern African Development Community in Pretoria, ZBC said. The couple were greeted by a delegation of government ministers when they arrived at Harare International Airport aboard an Air Zimbabwe aircraft, according to the state broadcaster. Engels laid a charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm after Grace Mugabe allegedly struck her on the head with an electrical extension cord. South African officials chose to remain coy on reports that Mugabe had left the country — despite police earlier saying they were on high alert to prevent her departure. Spokesperson for the Department of International Relations and Cooperation Clayson Monyela did not answer any phone calls made to him by TimesLIVE‚ and when sent text questions on the matter Monyela only responded on Sunday with‚ “Please speak to SAPS”. Monyela’s counterpart at the SA Police Service‚ Sally De Beer‚ was no more forthcoming‚ saying that she has never commented on the matter and referred TimesLIVE to her colleague at the police service‚ Vishnu Naidoo. When TimesLIVE contacted Naidoo for clarity on the matter we were met with the following recorded response: “Good day. If you are looking for information on the Sandton assault GBH case‚ until something significant develops I have nothing more to add.”
