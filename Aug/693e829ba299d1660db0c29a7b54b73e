Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Des van Rooyen announced an allocation of almost R75m to help the Western Cape provincial government tackle its drought disaster. Various municipalities in the Western Cape have instituted water use restrictions. The rains that have fallen since restrictions were imposed have not been sufficient to break the drought. Van Rooyen said his department and the interministerial task team on the drought intervention conducted an analysis that concluded continual risk-reduction measures should be introduced in provinces to mitigate the impact of water shortages. "The national Department of Water and Sanitation is monitoring the levels of 43 dams in the Western Cape weekly, some of which are in the winter rainfall areas of the province while others lie in the transitional area between winter and summer rainfall areas," Van Rooyen said. He said one of the key problems in the Western Cape as a result of the drought was a considerable shortage in animal feed, which had a severe impact on livestock. The bulk of the allocation to the Western Cape — about R40m of the R74.9m — government would therefore go towards animal feed, and would be spent by the provincial agriculture department. The other R34.9m will go to relief projects in the Cape Town metro (R20.8m), Bitou municipality (R10.9m) and Theewaterskloof municipality (R3.1m). Van Rooyen said the transfer of funds was based on conditions stipulated in the applicable grant frameworks to ensure accountability in terms of how the funds are used.
