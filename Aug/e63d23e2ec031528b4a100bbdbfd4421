South African bonds were weaker on Thursday morning as markets digested the news that President Jacob Zuma had survived another vote of no confidence. The rand, which bonds usually track, has lost most of the gains it had made on Monday afternoon when National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete announced that the vote would be done through a secret ballot. The rand firmed 1.48% to the dollar, trading at R13.23/$ by the end of Monday, with bonds gaining accordingly. After the announcement on Tuesday night that vote was in favour of the president the rand lost 15c, ending the day at R13.37/$, while bond yields edged higher. Apart from local political risk, geopolitical tension between the US and North Korea is also expected to affect the markets North Korea warned US President Donald Trump that its missiles could surround the US territory of Guam in an "enveloping fire" in coming weeks. Standard Bank analyst Warrick Butler said tension between the US and North Korea meant that risk aversion was likely to take hold on Wednesday, with the usual safe-haven assets attracting bids again. At 9am the R186 was bid at 8.645% from Tuesday’s 8.560% and R207 at 7.405% from 7.330%. The rand was at R13.4472 to the dollar from Tuesday’s R13.4386.
