African Rainbow Capital’s banking partner is close to getting a licence that it wants to use to challenge the dominance of SA’s biggest lenders. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia has said it will sell 10% of Tyme, a Johannesburg-based lender that allows customers to access funds through their cellphones, to billionaire Patrice Motsepe’s African Rainbow Capital (ARC) after buying the business in 2015. Tyme was granted a provisional licence by the Reserve Bank last year. "The licence is expected before the end of September," ARC co-CEO Johan van der Merwe said on Thursday. The regulator was looking at the cloud-based system that ARC’s fintech partner is using to make sure it works before granting the full licence, he said. SA’s four biggest banks, including Standard Bank and FirstRand, have not had to face competition in the consumer market since Capitec started more than 15 years ago. Now, the Reserve Bank has three provisional licensees: Tyme, insurer Discovery and the South African Post Office. Disrupting banks This comes as the ANC pushes for the creation of a state-owned bank to boost transformation in the sector by lending more to black individuals and businesses that have been excluded from the banking system. "The South African banking environment is due for a bit of disruption," Can der Merwe said. While Capitec has been able to play that role, the soon-to-be licensed lender will be a "disruption over and above that", he said. ARC plans to raise R4bn selling shares in its investment unit to selected investors. The sale will be followed by a JSE listing next month that will give African Rainbow Capital Investments a market value of about R8.5bn. The unit would have R2bn in cash for future purchases, Van der Merwe said. Bloomberg
