ANC branches in Pongola, in the north of KwaZulu-Natal, have endorsed the party’s treasurer-general, Zweli Mkhize, as a compromise candidate to lead the party and SA. This is the second endorsement for Mkhize ahead of the December ANC elective conference, after one from the Alfred Nzo region in the Eastern Cape. The ANC nomination process formally opens on Friday, but former African Union Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, ministers Lindiwe Sisulu and Jeff Radebe, Mkhize, and his predecessor as party treasurer, Mathews Phosa, have received nominations to enter the presidential race. Mkhize addressed a packed hall in Pongola on Sunday, where every speaker decried factionalism and divisions in the ANC. Ntokozo Hadebe, an ANC leader in Pongola, said they had chosen Mkhize for his principled stand throughout his cadreship in the ruling party. "We feel that he is best suited to lead us to the future. This is not a request [to Mkhize], it is a deployment and he must accept," Hadebe said. Mkhize seemed to accept the nomination. During his speech he said he was worried about ongoing factionalism and took a swipe at the Gupta family, saying they had created enmity within the ruling party. "We have deep divisions in the ANC. There is a Gupta group on one side, the other groups on the other. You also have people who want the ANC to return to its core values," he said. He reiterated that he was against President Jacob Zuma’s proposal that the losing ANC presidential candidate should be made a deputy. He also said he opposed disbanding ANC branches that decided to exercise their democratic choices, which amounted to bullying and denying members their right to choose leaders and policies. "You don’t ever disqualify branch nominations ….It’s always important to make sure that branches’ views can also be heard."
