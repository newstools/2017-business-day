George Lebese is happy at Kaizer Chiefs. That was all the winger would say, appearing to quell speculation that he wants away from Amakhosi. Breaking his silence on rumours that Lebese is eyeing a move from Chiefs after a season in which the star left wing featured less than normal‚ the player told TimesLIVE that for now, he was an Amakhosi player. He hinted that he did not foresee such a situation changing in the near future. Speculation has been rife that Mamelodi Sundowns have shown an interest in signing the skilful left wing‚ and that Lebese would be interested in such a move. "I am still with Kaizer Chiefs and that’s about as far as I go and where it stands at the moment. I am happy‚" Lebese said. The 28-year-old laughed at suggestions that he would look good in a Sundowns shirt. "I have heard the rumours about me joining Sundowns and to be honest, they [the speculations] have been with me since I turned pro. I am from Mamelodi and that’s my home‚ so the speculation doesn’t surprise me." Lebese made 22 league appearances for Chiefs in a 2016-17 season, with Amakhosi finishing fourth. That return was the same as his previous four seasons with Chiefs. However‚ unlike in those previous campaigns‚ the winger made an unusually high number of appearances coming off the bench in 2016-17 – eight – while he was also taken off in nine out of the 14 starts he made.
