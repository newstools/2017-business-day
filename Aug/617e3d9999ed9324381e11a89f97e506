The Guptas are pulling out of their media interests, selling their shareholding in Infinity Media and TNA for a combined R450m. Gupta-owned holding company Oakbay Investments made the announcement on Monday, saying that Lodidox — owned by Gupta-ally Mzwanele Manyi — and management would purchase the companies. Oakbay’s shareholding in Infinity Media, which operates the ANN7 News Channel, will be sold for R300m; and its two-thirds stake in TNA Media, the publisher of The New Age newspaper, will be sold for R150m. “The agreement is expected to be concluded over the next few weeks, subject to any regulatory requirements,” the Oakbay announcement said. It said the sale would allow Oakbay “the time to focus on clearing its name in the face of unfounded media allegations”. Commenting on the agreement, Oakbay acting CEO Ronica Ragavan said: “We are delighted to have reached an agreement with Lodidox and the management team. The sale of our shareholdings will secure the future of these businesses and help preserve the jobs of their employees. “Both businesses are inherently sound and well positioned for growth in their respective market segments. We wish them every success in the future.” Lodidox owner Mzwanele Manyi said he was “delighted to have reached agreement with Oakbay and look forward to successfully completing the deal. These are two strong businesses which are full of potential and, under the right external circumstances, can become an increasingly important and relevant part of the South African media landscape. “In addition, I am particularly impressed that the shareholders of Oakbay have agreed to do a vendor financing at acceptable terms as part of their commitment to transformation and to expedite the transaction.”
