Eskom’s success is critical for all the countries in the Southern African region, says president of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina. He was speaking at the National Treasury on Friday at the signing of a new host-country agreement between the bank and the South African government. EAdesina said Eskom was a factor in the economy’s weakening based on the lack of electricity for mining companies, which also impacted neighbouring countries. He said the bank would continue to invest and support Eskom. "It’s a sign of confidence in SA and a sign of confidence in Eskom ... SA cannot develop in the dark." Adesina also congratulated Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba for keeping "the economy’s head above water" adding there was "strong support from the African Development Bank about all the structural reforms you have here". The focus of the agreement is to help accelerate Africa’s development, said Adesina, who also explained that SA was the focus in the region because it made up 50% of the region’s GDP and is a stable country. Gigaba said: "SA has a great role to play on the African continent, not only in the multi-lateral development institutions but particularly in terms of mobilising our resources to support investment in Africa."
