After hours of voting in a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma, the majority of the National Assembly voted to keep him as president of the country. President Jacob Zuma spoke to a group of his supporters outside Parliament after the motion of no confidence failed to remove him from office. Here's how opposition parties reacted: EFF leader Julius Malema told his crowd of supporters outside of Parliament that he was proudly South African after the motion of no confidence failed to remove President Jacob Zuma. Malema also praised the masses for their dedication.
