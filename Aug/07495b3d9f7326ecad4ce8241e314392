South African Revenue Service (SARS) commissioner Tom Moyane has denied he met any member of the Gupta family during a visit to Dubai in December 2015. BDlive reported on Thursday that travel records showed Moyane to have been in Dubai at the same time as Gupta brothers Atul‚ Ajay and Rajesh "Tony"‚ as well as Duduzane Zuma; former Eskom chief financial officer Anoj Singh and Kim Davids‚ the then executive PA to Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Browne. Also in Dubai at that time — between December 23 2015 and January 8 2016 — were two sons of Free State Premier Ace Magushule were there. SARS had earlier said it would not comment on Moyane’s movements but in a statement on Friday said: "SARS can confirm that commissioner Moyane was in Dubai on December 23 2015‚ in transit to spend Christmas in Portugal. "SARS can further confirm that he returned to Dubai on December 29 2015 and returned to SA on January 8 2016‚" the statement reads. Brown asked Davids to resign this week after BDlive and others reported how her trip to Dubai had apparently been paid for by the Guptas. She claimed to have paid her own way and said she had stayed in Dubai after falling ill en route to Portugal. "Commissioner Moyane categorically states that he has never met any member of the Gupta family in either his private or professional capacity‚" SARS said‚ adding that the attempt to link the commissioner and SARS as an institution with the Gupta family or their associates was "malicious and reckless in the extreme". The statement said SARS invited anyone with "information to the contrary" to provide such to SARS or any organ of state. SARS is under pressure to explain the payment of a R70m VAT refund to Oakbay in June this year‚ with reports alleging that Moyane personally intervened to get the payment processed. SARS has declined to comment on these reports except to say the payment was not irregular.
