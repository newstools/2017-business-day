The rand was slightly firmer in early morning trade on Wednesday as the dollar battled to hold on to its stronger levels against the euro. The rand normally trades inversely to the dollar. Commodity prices were flat. The dollar gained against the euro on Tuesday on upbeat US retail sales data, which may lead to a more hawkish stance from US Federal Reserve. The release of the Fedâ€™s minutes on Wednesday is likely to provide further market guidance as to the extent of possible US rate increases this year. "The key points in the minutes that the markets would be looking at will be whether there is any mention of tapering of QE [quantitative easing] and when it will start and the other point being how concerned the Fed was with the troubling inflation number," said TreasuryOne currency dealer Andre Botha. US consumer inflation has remained at around 1.6% for the past seven months; the Fed has a target of 2%. The local market was also eyeing retail sales data for June. A better than expected number would be rand supportive as it is likely to boost already tepid GDP growth expectations for the year. At 8.59am the rand was at R13.2916 to the dollar from R13.3216, at R15.5959 to the euro from R15.6320 and at R17.0908 to the pound from R17.1466. The euro was unchanged at $1.1734. Nedbank Investment and Corporate Banking (CIB) analysts said that overnight trade in the rand had been subdued, adding that "despite the move to weaker levels, the local unit remained resilient".
