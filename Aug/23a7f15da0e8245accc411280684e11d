Not only are criminal syndicates stealing people’s homes, "most of these properties are then used as drug dens and turn our young girls as sex slaves," Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba said on Wednesday. "I am deeply concerned by allegations brought to my attention that honest, law abiding residents of the city are being illegally evicted from their homes by alleged criminal syndicates purporting to be in possession of valid eviction orders," Mashaba said in a statement. "This follows claims by residents of Joburg South, such as Rosettenville, Kenilworth, Turffontein, South Hills and surrounds, and Windsor in the west of the city, who allege to have suffered at the hands of such criminal syndicates." Mashaba said he had instructed the city’s legal team to investigate these allegations, and its forensic team was going to intensify raids in those communities to assess the size of the problem. "These criminals illegally construct additional units or structures on property they have illegally acquired and rent out these units for their own benefit; all while illegally connecting to the city’s services," Mashaba said.
