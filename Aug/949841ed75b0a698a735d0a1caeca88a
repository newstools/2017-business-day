Safe-haven trade prevailed in the markets on Tuesday after North Korea’s missile launch over Japan, with gold, US Treasuries and the yen the preferred asset classes as the dollar continued to reach record lows against the euro. The gold price rose sharply to $1,320.73/oz, the highest level yet in 2017, after South Korea announced that it had undertaken its own missile tests on the border with North Korea in retaliation, raising tension. "Now that gold has finally breached $1,300, I expect a surge in purchasing momentum. Investors might even be eyeing the potential to test 2016’s highs of $1,375," FXTM analyst Jameel Ahmad said. The JSE gold index also surged, although gains were capped in later trade after the rand broke through R13/$, reaching R12.9499 in intraday trade. The index closed 6.83% higher at 1,447.03 points. AngloGold Ashanti’s share price rose 7.81%, to R130.45 and Harmony’s 7.05%, to R25.51. The dollar weakened to $1.2070 to the euro, its worst in 28 months, surprising analysts, as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) officially remained set to further increase interest rates when the time is right. "The dollar, which often served as a safe-haven port during periods of geopolitical tension, had remained surprisingly weak," said analysts at Momentum SP Reid said. The dollar has lost 14% against the euro so far in 2017. At the beginning of 2017, it looked set to reach parity with the euro. The dollar also lost against the yen in safe-haven trade, but not to the extent of the euro, and is 7% down for the year against the Japanese currency. In late trade, the yen was at ¥108.81/$, up 0.4% from opening at ¥109.25/$. US Treasuries were firmer with the yield of the US 10-year bond falling to 2.098%, from 2.1563%. US bonds have been trending firmer after the Jackson Hole conference at the weekend. Investors had hoped to get clarity on the Fed’s policy plans, but not much was said by chair Janet Yellen. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi also refrained from comment on the possible tapering of the bank’s loose monetary policies. The effects of Jackson Hole on local bonds have been limited. The yield on the R186 was unchanged at 8.57% in late trade on Tuesday, while the R207 was bid at 7.33%, from 7.305%. Analysts said there were still many aspects supporting local bonds, including the prospect of lower inflation, as bonds benefit from declining inflation. "However, political risk was weighing on bond markets," said Old Mutual Multi-Managers investment strategist Dave Mohr. It was touch-and-go whether Moody’s and S&P Global Ratings would further cut SA’s local currency ratings, leading to forced selling by global bond index investors, he said. But even in those adverse conditions, there would still be plenty of buyers of rand bonds, even after a further downgrade. "The question is, how much would the yield have to move up to entice them to invest?" mittnerm@fm.co.za
