A United Arab Emirates businessman using a Swiss shelf company is investing R2.97bn to buy the Gupta family’s Tegeta mining company, which is under investigation for dubious dealings in its purchase of the Optimum colliery. Tegeta Resources and Exploration will be sold by Oakbay Investments owned by the Gupta family, which is close to President Jacob Zuma. A few days ago, Oakbay agreed to sell broadcaster ANN7 and The New Age newspaper to Lodidox, a shelf company owned by former government spin doctor and Gupta and Zuma cheerleader Mzwanele Manyi for R450m.
