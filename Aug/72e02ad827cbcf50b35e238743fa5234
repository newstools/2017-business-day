The JSE crept higher on Wednesday morning, as investors watched for results from Hong Kong-based Tencent later in the day. Shortly after the JSE opened, Naspers, which owns about a third of the Chinese tech giant, was up 0.18% at R2,810. It is widely expected that Tencent’s second-quarter results will show significant revenue growth. The local retail sector will be in focus on Wednesday, as SA considers its own subdued economic outlook, even while global economic growth picks up. At 9.30am the all share was up 0.55% to 55,285.7 points, and the top-40 0.65%. Resources added 1.18%, banks 0.66%, financials 0.63% and property stocks 0.52%. Platinums were down a marginal 0.05%. Statistics SA is expected to release retail trade data for June at 1pm, and follows upbeat US retail sales data on Tuesday. The uptick in household expenditure in the world’s largest economy has increased the prospect of a more hawkish stance from the US Federal Reserve. Analysts said risk-on sentiment was expected to continue to lift global markets in coming sessions, but expected subdued trade on Wednesday. The market was preparing for the Fed’s open market committee meeting minutes on Wednesday evening, "and the bulls are being corralled in anticipation of an optimistic Fed", said Sasfin Securities bond analysts. The Fed’s rhetoric was well known by now, and something was required to "jumpstart the markets", said Standard Bank currency trader Warrick Butler.
