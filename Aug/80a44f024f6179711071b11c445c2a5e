New Infinity Media owner Mzwanele Manyi has provided share certificates showing he is the sole shareholder of Lodidox, his company which has bought the Gupta's media assets. In a bizarre briefing with media at the ANN7 studios in Midrand, Johannesburg on Wednesday, Manyi said the application by some media houses to have his company information public was "unusual". He said there was a "malicious narrative" around his acquisition of the Infinity Media and TNA. Journalists attending the briefing were made to sit in the ANN7 studio as guests while the television channel took the so-called briefing live. Last week Oakbay Investments announced its withdrawal from its media interests‚ selling its shareholding in Infinity Media and TNA to Lodidox and management‚ for a combined R450m. Manyi seems to have grossly overpaid for Infinity Media, something he has denied.
