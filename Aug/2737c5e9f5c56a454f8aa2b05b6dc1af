The JSE opened marginally firmer on Thursday, the first trading day after President Jacob Zuma’s narrow victory in the no-confidence motion, with Wednesday a public holiday. The gains came as gold shares rocketed on rising geopolitical tension, while global shares were mostly lower. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.17% lower at 22,048.70 on Wednesday. Asian markets were lower on Thursday morning with the Nikkei 225 losing 0.05% and the Hang Seng off 1.14%. "Increased tension between the US and North Korea weighed on the US market with all three of the major averages closing marginally lower," analysts at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) said. Spot gold was 0.07% higher at $1,278.30 after having risen 1.4% on Wednesday. The rand was at R13.4221 to the dollar from R13.4386. Analysts had expected a successful parliamentary motion of no confidence in the president to have a positive effect on local equities, but the narrowness of the victory was also seen as potentially positive as it was an indication of Zuma’s loosening grip on power. "We expect the consequences of the vote to reflect in volatile trade today," TreasuryOne analyst Andre Botha said. At 9.37am the all share was 0.32% up at 56,157.30 and the blue-chip top 40 added 0.34%. The gold index rose 5.91%, resources 1.70%, platinum 1.73%, food and drug retailers 0.42% and property 0.36%.
