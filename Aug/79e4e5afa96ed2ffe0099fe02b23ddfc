The rand was on the defensive on Thursday morning, succumbing to a deterioration in global risk sentiment. The war rhetoric between North Korea and the US has escalated over the past 24 hours, leaving global markets jittery as they pondered the potential implications. As a result, the rand weakened towards R13.50/$ in early trade, making a sharp U-turn from highs of R13.11/$ on Tuesday. But the bulk of the rand’s losses came after President Jacob Zuma survived a motion of no confidence vote on Tuesday, with the local currency losing 16c to the dollar immediately after the announcement of the result of the secret ballot on the motion. The DA, supported by other opposition parties, had brought the no confidence motion after Zuma’s controversial Cabinet reshuffle in March, leading to SA’s debt ratings being downgraded by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch. "It feels like the rand is finally ready to break and higher [weaker] is my call. The stars are sort of aligning now," Standard Bank trader Warrick Butler said in a note. "The fundamentals are crying out for a weaker currency, the politics continue to delight in terms of entertainment but infuriate in terms of resolution." At 9.20am, the rand was at R13.4668 to the dollar from R13.4386, at R15.7899 to the euro from R15.8034, and at R17.4659 to the pound from R17.4751. The euro was at $1.1726 from $1.1759.
