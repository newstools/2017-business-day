The JSE opened firmer on Thursday, supported by Standard Bank and Gold Fields on upbeat results and a positive trading update from troubled cement producer PPC. Gold shares were higher after the dollar lost ground against the euro in the wake of the US Federal Reserve minutes. The minutes, released on Wednesday, indicated seemingly divided views over the timing of future interest-rate increases in the face of weak consumer inflation. "The dovish minutes resulted in a further cut in expectations of a third interest hike this year by the US central bank, which weakened the dollar and improved global appetite for risk," said TreasuryOne trader Phillip Pearce.
