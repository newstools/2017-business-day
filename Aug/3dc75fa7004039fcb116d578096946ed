What do we know about Charles King, the company buying Tegeta Exploration & Resources for almost R3bn from Oakbay? Not a whole lot, actually. And very little is know about its owner, Amin al-Zarooni, though ANC MP Pravin Gordhan says he has received a tip that Zarooni is a player in the fashion world. Charles King does not have its own website. It was founded in 2011. The only management listed for the company is Ronald Alfred Beau — presumably the same Ronald A Beau of Beau HLB, a financial services company offering “a full range of fiduciary services for corporate and private clients”. It has a capitalisation of Sf100,000 — that’s a little under R1.4m at Wednesday’s exchange rate, and a lot under the Tegeta sale price of R2.97bn. Oakbay’s statement made no mention of whether this deal was vendor financed, as in the sale of its media assets to Mzwanele Manyi’s Lodidox. From catwalk to coal mine? Wednesday’s statement quotes Charles King owner Amin al-Zarooni. What do we know about him? Also not a lot. We do know, from the statement, that he’s quite upbeat on SA’s mining industry. What we don’t know is how long he has been the owner of Charles King, or much at all about his history as a businessperson. ANC MP Pravin Gordhan said he had been tipped off that Zoorani was a player in the fashion world. “We should have our urgency fuelled by these successive disposals‚ within 48 hours‚ of South African assets,” Gordhan said. “I am getting SMSes which say the person or entity that is supposed to have bought the coal asset‚ is active in trade with fashion products‚ clothing articles and shoes. “What are they doing buying coal mines from Switzerland? There’s something strange that seems to be going on.” The former finance minister is now a member of parliament’s portfolio committee on public enterprises‚ which on Wednesday discussed plans to probe state capture allegations.
