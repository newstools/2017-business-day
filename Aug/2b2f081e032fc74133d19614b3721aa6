EFF leader Julius Malema says any criminal who points a firearm at a law enforcement officer must shot. Speaking to Capricorn FM on Monday night, Malema said crime in the country had reached unacceptable levels. "The levels of crime are worrying. Criminals are no longer scared of authorities. They steal guns from police and military‚" he said. Malema said criminals were not afraid of any authorities‚ and even conducted their activities at places like OR Tambo International Airport. "Any criminal that points a firearm to a law enforcement official must be shot to kill… It can’t be criminals that kill police because we say that police must act with restraint‚" he added. He said that if Deputy Minister of Higher Education Mduduzi Manana were an EFF member‚ he would have been charged by now and would be facing an internal disciplinary process. In the interview that covered a range of issues‚ Malema said he was pleased with the progress that had been made by the EFF in a short space of time. He said the ANC had celebrated past elections while its support was dwindling. "They are unable to see a problem coming." Malema told a listener who complained about the party’s structures in KwaZulu-Natal that the province was being prioritised by the EFF’s leadership. "[KwaZulu-Natal] is very important for us for 2019. We’ve assigned Mbuyiseni Ndlozi as the convener there." He said KwaZulu-Natal was where the ANC was building its support base for 2019‚ hence the EFF must make it a strategic priority. He warned that the ANC would die a natural death and reincarnate in red.
