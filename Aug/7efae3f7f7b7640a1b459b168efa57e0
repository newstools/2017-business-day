Tignes — South African world champion long jumper Luvo Manyonga’s attempt at the world record ended in disappointment on Wednesday. At a specially arranged meeting in the French Alps at the bottom of the Grande Motte glacier and at 3,032m above sea level, Manyonga leapt 8.46m, which was just two centimetres off his gold-winning jump at the world championships in London. But it was well off Mike Powell’s 26-year-old record of 8.95m. Although the altitude was expected to help in a world record attempt, strong winds made conditions difficult. "I was a little disappointed, the wind was pushing me. But I feel that I have 9m within me," said Manyonga. At the same meet, world and Olympic champion Christian Taylor suffered a double failure as he attempted to break the triple-jump world record. The 27-year-old double Olympic and triple world champion not only failed to trouble Jonathan Edwards’s 22-year-old record of 18.29m, but he also finished second to American compatriot Will Claye. Claye won with a modest effort of 17.42m, while Taylor’s jump was 16.99m well off his personal best of 18.21m. AFP
