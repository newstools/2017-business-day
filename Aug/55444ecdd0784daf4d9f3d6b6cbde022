Japanese fast-fashion retailer Miniso has entered the local market, adding a fresh challenge in the competitive sector. Miniso, aimed at women aged 18 to 30 years old, has opened two stores in SA in the past month and plans to open three more by September. The retailer has built its brand on its ability to update its product offering every seven days. The group has a presence in more than 50 countries. "At Miniso, we pursue a simple and natural life philosophy," said human resources director Phoebe Dongxiang. "The personalised, smart shopping experience is what consumers in 2017 crave and we have an exceptional offering with something for everyone." Old Mutual investment professional Meryl Pick said clothing retail was a difficult space to be in. "The most competitive space is ladies fashion and as a result we have seen aggressive discounting which pulls margins down," said Pick. She said retailers with exposure to other categories such as sports and homeware were better suited to navigating the competitive environment. Minisoâ€™s products include consumer goods, health and beauty, jewellery and accessories, creative homeware and digital products. gokoc@bdlive.co.za
