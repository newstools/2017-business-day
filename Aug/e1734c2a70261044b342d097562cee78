Acquisitive education group Curro maintained its interim revenue growth at 24%, but losses contributed by its "lower-fee" school arm Meridian and its tertiary education arm Stadio slowed its profit growth to 31% from 67%. Curro reported on Tuesday that it cracked the R1bn interim revenue barrier in the six months to end-June, maintaining the 24% revenue growth pace set in the matching period. The group segments itself into three businesses: its flagship Curro private school brand, which grew revenue 28% to R915m and headline earnings 64% to R128m; Meridian, which grew revenue 4% to R136m while its headline loss nearly quadrupled to R15m from R4m; and Stadio, which grew revenue 26% to R24m but fell into a headline loss of R3m from headline earnings of R7m in the matching period. "Curro performed well overall, despite the seven Meridian campuses, operating in the rural lower-fee market, experiencing pressure as a result of lower learner numbers compared to the previous year." Stadioâ€™s loss was "due to corporate costs incurred in establishing and operating the head office component required for its pending separation as well as acquisition-related transaction costs," the company said in its results statement. Curro said it increased its number of schools by 12 to 127, its number of campuses by five to 54, and its number of learners by 3,819 to 47,002 during the six months.
