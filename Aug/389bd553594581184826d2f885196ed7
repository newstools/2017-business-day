The Hawks are investigating charges that public funds were spent on a wedding of the Gupta family in Sun City back in 2013. Hawks acting priority crimes head Brig Mokgadi Bokaba told members of a joint committee meeting in Parliament that the unit was looking into the Gupta e-mails as well as accusations surrounding a wedding in the Gupta family which was reportedly bankrolled by South African taxpayers. Reports emerged earlier this year of how funding was redirected from the Free State government’s coffers to the lavish wedding in Sun City. The charges were laid by the opposition DA. The Hawks team also said it was working hard to stem illicit currency outflows. “Fifty-four referrals fall within the definition of illicit financial flows. Gauteng with 33 referrals, KwaZulu-Natal has 11 and the remaining ten come from the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Free State, Limpopo and Mpumalanga,” Hawks acting head Lt-Gen Yolisa Matakata told the sitting. She said three of the referrals from the Reserve Bank had been finalised in court. Two referrals were withdrawn while 24 were under investigation, she said. The Hawks received 121 referrals from the Financial Intelligence Centre, 23 of which resulted in case dockets being opened. Of these, 12 were still under investigation while 10 were closed as undetected and one was withdrawn as a result of the accused being deceased. The Reserve Bank’s financial surveillance head, Thys Basson, said it had effected R115m in blocking orders since April 2017. Forfeiture notices to the value of R9m were published in the same period. However, only 51 cases were referred to law enforcement for contraventions amounting to R4.5bn. Standing committee member for the ANC Yunus Carrim said the low rate of prosecution and conviction for those implicated in illicit financial flows was disappointing and “not credible”. magubanek@businesslive.co.za
