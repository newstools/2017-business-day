The president’s son Edward Zuma has finally apologised for his vitriolic open letter in which he attacked senior ANC leaders Pravin Gordhan and Derek Hanekom. ANC KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli confirmed on Thursday morning that Zuma had apologised for calling former finance minister Gordhan "a stooge of white monopoly capital" and former tourism minister Hanekom a "white Afrikaner askari". The ANC in the province had given Edward until midnight on Wednesday to retract his letter or face the consequences. Ntuli said Zuma called him on Thursday morning informing him that he had sent the letter to the ANC offices on Wednesday. "We did not get a letter [on Wednesday] but he just gave [me] a call now and forwarded me a letter that he says he sent to the ANC office yesterday apologising‚" said Ntuli, who added that whether or not the apology made the deadline would not be discussed at the party’s provincial executive committee at its meeting this weekend. On Wednesday, Zuma said he would only comment on his letter at a press conference that he will call soon. But he is not entirely off the hook yet as he is still facing an investigation by the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) over "statements that promote hatred based on race". In his response to the investigation‚ Zuma described the SAHRC as "vile dog unleashed to maul the black majority‚ to manage them‚ to sanitise their history and to keep them in check when expressing their history and articulating their black pain".
