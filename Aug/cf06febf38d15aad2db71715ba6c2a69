Consumer inflation slowed much as expected in July, with the consumer price index rising 4.6% from a year earlier. That was slower than June’s 5.1% increase, and better than the expectations of 4.7%-4.8%, and meant inflation was within the Reserve Bank’s 3%-6% target band for the fourth month. Investec’s Kamilla Kaplan had expected inflation to slow to 4.7%, citing falling fuel prices and slowing food inflation. A smaller electricity price increase than a year earlier would also help, she said. Statistics SA’s data showed on Wednesday that food prices rose 6.8% from a year earlier in July, after a 7% increase in June. Fuel prices fell 3.6% compared with a year earlier, and 4.8% between June and July, while energy inflation was 2.1%. The CPI rose 0.3% in July from June. The Reserve Bank cut interest rates for the first time in five years when its monetary policy committee met in July, largely as a result of the improving inflation outlook. With the drought across most of SA having eased, food prices have been falling steadily. Fuel prices — which fell more than 60c a litre in July — depend on a combination of the international oil price and the rand/dollar exchange rate. Both these factors have moved in the wrong direction in recent weeks, and prices are expected to rise again in August, by roughly the same amount as July’s reduction.
