Wednesday may be another good day for the JSE’s gold miners, but bad day for banks if the rand continues its slide. The gold miners’ index rose 6.9% while the bank index lost 3.3% on Tuesday after rand weakened from R12.78/$ to R12.89/$ on the shock news SA’s economy contracted for a second quarter in a row when it was widely expected to have rebounded. Besides the weakening local currency, gold’s flirtation with $1,300/oz also boosted miners. The gold miners’ index was led higher by Sibanye, which gained 7.5% to R16.76, followed by AngloGold Ashanti, which rose 7.26% to R156.23, Gold Fields, up 6.65% to R50.66, and Harmony, adding 6.47% to R26. Standard Bank suffered most from the rand’s fall, which sent its share price down 4.29% to R143.57, followed by Barclays Africa Group, which fell 3.55% to R146.60, Nedbank, down 2.97% to R212, and FirstRand, 2.61% to R48.50. The JSE’s UK-focused shares are likely to have a torrid few days, especially if Thursday’s election leads to a hung parliament. Brait’s share price fell 3.14% to R74 on Tuesday after its UK clothing chain New Look reported its profit dropped by more than a third. Cement maker PPC warned shareholders on June 1 that it expected to report on Wednesday that its headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the year to end-March would tumble by up to 95%. PPC said its HEPS would be in the range of 5c-16c from the previous year’s R1.07. The cement group said that excluding the dilution caused by its rights issue and part of a black economic empowerment transaction, the fall in HEPS was between 25% and 35%.
