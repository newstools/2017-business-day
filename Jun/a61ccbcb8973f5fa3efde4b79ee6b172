The JSE opened lower on Thursday as the market awaited a range of happenings on the day which may influence its direction. Global markets have been cautious ahead of what has been dubbed "Super Thursday" by analysts. The Dow Jones closed 0.18% higher at 21,173.69 points on Wednesday. Asian markets were mixed on Thursday as the Nikkei 225 shed 0.38% and the Hang Seng gained 0.29%. The UK election takes place on Thursday, with the Conservatives under Prime Minister Theresa May expected to win. There is, however, uncertainty as to the margin of her victory with recent polls indicating a much closer outcome against Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party than the landslide that was expected a month ago. An surprise Labour victory, or even a lacklustre Conservative performance, could send the pound much weaker. The European Central Bank (ECB) statement could possibly present a less hawkish stance than previously expected. The market is looking for a signal that the bank is set to ease its accommodative policies on recent upbeat economic data and views expressed by German chancellor Angela Merkel that the euro was too weak. "The ECB is unlikely to change interest rates, but may maintain a hawkish tone," Nedbank analysts said. In the US, public testimony from former FBI director James Comey could unleash fresh problems for the administration of President Donald Trump ahead of the independent inquiry into his ties with Russia, which might have swung the November election in his favour. This all is happening against the backdrop of Moody’s latest pronouncement on SA’s creditworthiness on Friday, which is bound to affect local trading. "Moody’s is expected to downgrade SA’s credit rating by one notch, with a negative outlook," Nedbank said. The rand and bonds have held up relatively well this week, but may weaken if global risk-off sentiment takes hold.
