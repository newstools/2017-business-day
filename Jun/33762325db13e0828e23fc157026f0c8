The imposition of a contentious new Mining Charter by Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane on Thursday slashed the value of JSE-listed mining stocks R50.69bn, making the sector “uninvestable” and subject to a spate of legal challenges.

The charter, which includes the demand for companies to top up empowerment ownership holding to 30% within 12 months, from the 26% target for end-2014 among a host of controversial clauses, made “South African miners uninvestable to a large segment of the market and it will be very tough to attract fresh capital to an already unloved sector”, Investec said in a note to its clients.
