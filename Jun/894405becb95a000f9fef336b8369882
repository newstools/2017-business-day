The JSE opened weaker on Monday after the downgrade by Moody’s on Friday, as industrials retreated on a weaker Naspers. Naspers, which is included in the industrial index, was more than 2% lower on profit-taking following an upbeat performance last week. Losses among banks were fairly contained after the opening but general retailers were weaker ahead of the April retail sales numbers set to be released on Wednesday. Economists expect growth in the sector to remain positive, although at a monthly 0.2% lower from a previous 0.8%, following the dismal mining and manufacturing data released last week. Property stocks were flat with a weaker bias. Gold shares were lower on a marginally firmer dollar. On Friday evening, Moody’s cut its sovereign credit rating for SA to Baa3 from Baa2, one notch above junk. Moody’s held its outlook on SA as negative, raising the fear of another downgrade in December. Market focus has turned to the outcome of Wednesday’s US Federal Reserve federal open market committee meeting. The Fed is expected to hike rates for the second time this year, despite inflationary prospects remaining negative to the downside. "We expect the Fed to deliver a rate hike and open the door to balance sheet run-off in September," analysts at Barclays Research said. That means a further tightening of monetary policies as the European Central Bank (ECB) is also mulling similar actions later in the year.
