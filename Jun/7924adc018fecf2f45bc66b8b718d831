Far from giving Trillian Capital the whitewash its owner and "fourth Gupta brother" Salim Essa presumably thought he was paying for, advocate Geoff Budlender’s inquiry brought to light that Trillian skimmed R266m from Eskom for no services rendered and paid R160m to the Guptas via their shared bank, Baroda. Trillian management refused to answer Budlender’s questions about a mysterious Dubai-based company called E Gateway Global Consultants. Budlender asked about E Gateway because it concerned McKinsey so much, the US firm refused to use Trillian as a subcontractor. Now investigators of the leaked Gupta e-mails have dubbed E Gateway the Guptas’ Dubai laundromat.
