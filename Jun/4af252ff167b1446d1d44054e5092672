Statistics SA is scheduled to release May’s producer price index (PPI) dada at 11:30am. Investec Bank economist Kamilla Kaplan said in her weekly note e-mailed on Friday that annual producer inflation could show a slight lift to 4.7% in May from 4.6% in April since petrol prices rose 47c/l and diesel prices 30c/l. "The recovery in international oil prices has seen local petrol and diesel price growth in year-on-year terms since November 2016, which has translated into higher contributions of the petroleum component of the basket to headline PPI inflation. "However, the retreat in the oil price from a recent peak of $57 a barrel in December 2016 to $45 a barrel presently has contributed to the petrol and diesel price cuts of 25c/l and 23c/l in June. The Department of Energy is currently estimating a substantial petrol price cut of 67c/l for July. In terms of other considerations, the May PPI update is also likely to reflect ongoing manufactured food price disinflation and deflation at the agricultural level," Kaplan wrote.
