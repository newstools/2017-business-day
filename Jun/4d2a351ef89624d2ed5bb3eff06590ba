Denel chairman Daniel Mantsha fed sensitive and classified company information to the Gupta family and forwarded the family some of his personal bills, leaked e-mails show. Former Eskom CE Brian Molefe lodged a notice of motion in the Labour Court at the weekend, notifying Eskom and Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown that he would lodge his application in the court on Monday. The leaked Gupta e-mails show how different strategies worked together to gain outcomes: the co-ordinated insertion of loyalists into key state institutions; using them to gather information; inserting a superfluous purchasing body between the buyer and the seller to disguise how money was skimmed; using tame "advisory" organisations to subvert purchasing decisions; greasing the necessary palms; and moving the money around to disguise where it came from," writes Tim Cohen. Gupta associates in Transnet helped inflate the price paid for 1,068 locomotives in 2014 from R39bn to R52bn, helping the family pocket R5.3bn. But even this massive cash pile does not seem to have lasted more than a couple of years, writes Stuart Theobald. Telkom shareholders will receive a 56% higher dividend for the year to end-March 2017 than in the previous year, the telecommunications group said in its results on Monday morning.
