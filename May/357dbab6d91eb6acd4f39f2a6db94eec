The JSE started the week on a flat note despite Naspers scaling new heights and as mining stocks lost ground on the stronger rand. After tumbling 3% on Thursday the rand has steadily recovered against the dollar, reaching R13.1593/$ on Monday morning. Platinum and gold were flat at $937/oz and $1,255/oz respectively. Naspers’s Chinese Tencent investment, of which it owns 34%, was sharply higher in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng index up 0.77%. The Shanghai Composite shed 0.48%. The Nikkei 225 was 0.45% up after the Dow Jones closed 0.69% higher on Friday as President Donald Trump left the US for his first overseas presidential trip. Analysts said global market sentiment remained positive, despite last week’s sharp dip in the Dow and the expectation of imminent US rate increases. "Despite bouts of concern, almost all central banks remain supportive of growth," analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said. They said even the Fed was increasing rates for "good reasons" because the economy could handle it, not because of inflation concerns. Perhaps the biggest challenge was not the Fed rate increases or the expectation that the European Central Bank (ECB) would pullback on its stimulus policies, but China’s attempt to rein in its shadow banking system, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.
