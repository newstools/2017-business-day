Economic growth slumped in March and could show further decline when the April figures are released next month. The Reserve Bank’s leading indicator, which is used to gauge growth, is expected to dip further next month as it takes into account the Cabinet reshuffle and credit rating downgrades. The indicator is a strong projection of SA’s economic growth cycle for the next 12 months. After an increase of 1.1% in February, it slumped to 0.4% month to month in March. The biggest negative contributor to the drop in the composite leading indicator was a decrease in SA’s produced export commodity price index (US dollar based) which was positive the month before, followed by a deceleration in the six-month smoothed growth in the real money supply. "We tend to look at the leading indicator over a long period. It’s useful, but since March there have been dramatic changes. It’s actually doing relatively well if you look at it over six months," said Nascence Advisory and Research economist Xhanti Payi. Investment Solutions economist Lesiba Mothata said: "Clearly the cyclical momentum generated has waned because confidence has been knocked down further. "Commodity prices are rolling over — not dramatically yet, but they’re rolling over. SA is very connected to the commodity cycle and that negatively impacts the global conditions that have been working for SA." Mothata said confidence and the manufacturing sector had taken a knock and the retail sector was also expected to take a dive in the coming months. "There are a few companies in conversation about retrenchments with trade unions. We’re going to see a hit in the retail sector," he said.ator decreased 0.5% month-on-month.
