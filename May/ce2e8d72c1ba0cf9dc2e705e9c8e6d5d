While Rhodes Foods is equipped to weather SA’s difficult trading conditions, the outlook for the rest of the year is challenging and this will come with margin pressure, CEO Bruce Henderson says. “There is no doubt that the second half of our financial year will be challenging as we do not expect any improvement in the trading environment and expect to face margin pressure,” said Henderson. “However, we traded in similar conditions in the first half and reported strong growth in our regional segment, gained market share in all our key product categories and delivered earnings growth of 15.9%,” Henderson said. In the six months to April 2, Rhodes reported an increase in headline earnings of 15.9% to R126m. Turnover rose 8.2% to R2.2bn while profit after tax rose 14.6% to R125m. Regional sales, which include SA and the rest of Africa, increased by 17.9% in the period under review but international sales dropped 20.7% owing mainly to the strengthening of the rand. against the group’s basket of trading currencies. “We have seen a tougher trading environment with some consumer resistance to price increases especially in canned food where people are looking for value,” said Henderson. “But overall, our fresh foods division grew sales by 27.8% with excellent growth in pies and snacking while sales in the long-life foods division increased by 12.3% despite the tougher trading environment both domestically and in other African markets,” he said. While Rhodes would always be on the lookout for acquisition targets, Henderson said in the short to medium term the two new businesses, Packo and Ma Baker, would be in focus. By the close of the JSE on Tuesday, Rhodes’s share price was down 4.81% at R22.18, valuing the company at about R5.6bn.
