The rand, which has strengthened more than 4% over the past week, held on to its gains on Tuesday morning, trading at about R13.18/$ at 7am. The rand gaining 1.3% on Monday outweighed the US’s S&P 500 index rising 0.5% to a fresh record of 2,402 points, causing the Coreshares exchange-traded fund (ETF), which tracks it, to fall 0.7% to R31.76. Deutsche Bank’s MSCI US index tracking ETF similarly fell 0.66% to R30.18. Oil’s rally on Monday sent Standard Bank’s West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price-tracking exchange-traded note up 1.9% to R8.99, but the stronger rand dampened Sasol’s rise to 0.3% to R408.50. WTI was trading 0.4% higher at $48.94 a barrel and Brent crude was similarly 0.4% higher at $51.90 a barrel on Tuesday morning. Platinum was 0.44% higher at $932.82/oz and gold 0.3% higher at $1,234/oz ahead of the JSE opening on.
