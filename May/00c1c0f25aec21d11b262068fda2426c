A group of foundations, including some started by former presidents and struggle stalwarts, have decided to join forces as a result of their concern about the direction SA is taking. There has been a groundswell of initiatives by political parties, civil society, struggle stalwarts and citizens following the recent Cabinet reshuffle in which Pravin Gordhan was removed as finance minister, and which led the country's credit rating to be downgraded to junk status. The foundations that have now come to together to hold national dialogues to discuss concerns are the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Foundation; the Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe Foundation; the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation; the Thabo Mbeki Foundation; the Helen Suzman Foundation; the Jakes Gerwel Foundation; the FW De Klerk Foundation; and the Umlambo Foundation (whose patron is Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka).  The foundations first met on April 9. On Friday, the group will host its inaugural National Dialogue in Johannesburg under the theme, “Why does SA Need a National Dialogue? A Call to the Nation.” They said their shared view was that the challenges facing the country needed to be attended to as a matter of urgency. The group also believed that these challenges had generated a “national crisis which negatively affects our democracy”.
