Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba’s first state of the city address presented a plan that he argues is pro-poor and corruption busting and will result in the insourcing of security services. Mashaba’s address on Wednesday preceded a key vote on the draft medium-term budget, which requires EFF councillors’ votes to pass. Mashaba said R2bn in fraud and corruption had been exposed across a number of municipal departments and entities by former Gauteng Hawks head Maj-Gen Shadrack Sibiya’s internal investigative unit. Sibiya was employed by the council to tackle corruption. “Today I can confirm that over 300 cases are currently being investigated and the total monetary value alleged to be lost or misused as a result of fraud or corruption is over R10bn,” Mashaba said. A minimum of 60% of the city’s budget for capital expenditure would be directed towards traditionally poor and underserviced communities. This had to drive service delivery, infrastructure investment and efficiency of transport for the poorest. The draft budget, which the council will vote on later in May, allocates about R8.6bn for capital expenditure in the financial year 2017-18. Mashaba announced plans to extend hours at clinics and to insource the city’s security services. The insourcing would be initiated on January 1 2018. The city’s approach to housing would involve providing serviced plots of land on which beneficiaries could settle. The beneficiaries would then have to build their own homes on the plots of land. Chairman of the EFF in Johannesburg Musa Novela said the party was happy that the administration was ready to implement resolutions and motions that the EFF had brought in council, and that those found expression in the state of the city address. But he said that if the address was not reflected in the draft budget, “then it won’t get our support”.
