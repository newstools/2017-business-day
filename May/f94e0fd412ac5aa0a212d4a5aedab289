While infomercials and call lines seem to have mostly been relegated to the past, profitable opportunities remain in direct selling using new channels such as physical stores and e-commerce, say Verimark CEO Michael van Straaten. After a dismal showing last year, the company reported a 200% jump in full-year headline earnings on Tuesday to R25.9m. Pleased investors helped drive the price of the little-traded share up more than 20%. “We’ve been in this game for over 40 years and we have had to adapt, innovate and grow in that time. Direct selling is far from dead. We are ahead of the curve as we have a great team and we have the benefit of experience behind us,” he said. Verimark, which has been listed on the JSE since 2005, has produced some hit-and-miss results. While the share price is up 82% over the past two years, this is far off from the retailer’s record high of R4.20 reached on April 11 2006. The shares now trade at about 89c. Van Straaten said there were still benefits to staying publicly listed. “As an entrepreneur, you always want to go to the next level. If we ever want to grow or expand our business, being listed will allow us to get funding. But there aren’t any plans in the works now that would require that.” In the year to end-February 2017, Verimark said the strengthening of the rand exchange rate to the US dollar in the period resulted in improved buying power for imported products. Profit before tax rose 183.8% to R37.3m as the company increased prices and the rand strengthened to R12.94/$ from R16.12/$ in the year-earlier period. But the higher selling prices limited revenue growth, which was up just 1.9% to R439.1m. Headline earnings per share rose to 24c from 8c, while the dividend per share rose to 11.30c from 3.70c. “We are optimistic about the future. We remain confident that the resilience of our business model and the overall talent of our people will allow Verimark to produce improved results going forward,” he said.
