Merrick Bremner hit a few hurdles down the home straight at Waterkloof Golf Club, but a solid two-putt par at the closing hole netted the five-time Sunshine Tour winner first prize in the IGT Challenge Tour’s Waterkloof Challenge on Wednesday. "I made a strong start, but I missed a few opportunities down the back nine," Bremner said after his final round 68 and four-stroke victory on a 19-under-par 197. "I’m really happy with the shape I’m in after the two weeks on the IGT Challenge Tour, though," he said. "I feel ready to take my game to the Zimbabwe Open. "It’s been great to get some game time, remove the rust and focus before the start of the Sunshine Tour." The 31-year-old began the last 18 holes with a two-shot lead over Matias Calderon from Chile and he had four shots on Sunshine Tour rookie Herman Loubser. "I birdied the second and third and picked up another birdie at seven to turn three under with my nose still in front after Matias birdied four and eagled the par five. "We both scrambled for birdies at 15, but the momentum shifted in my favour at 16 after Mat made an unlucky double. "We both hit it in the drink at 17 and had to up-and-down for bogey, but I hit a proper tee shot down the 18th fairway, put it safely on the green and two-putted for the win." Meanwhile, Calderon bogeyed the last hole for a 71 round total to finish on his own in third on 202. Loubser moved into fourth on 203 with a 70 while Dainfern’s Matthew Spacey produced a flawless 66 to leapfrog both fellow Sunshine Tour rookies and close out second place at 15 under.
