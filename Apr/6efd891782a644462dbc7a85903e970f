Tasima, operator of the electronic national administration traffic information system (eNatis) has, once again, resisted attempts at a take-over of the system. On Thursday the company accused the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) of "storming its premises", despite an indication the company wanted to return to court.Tasima said on Thursday that it would now petition the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA), after the High Court in Pretoria, on Wednesday, rejected a request for leave to appeal a judgment against the company earlier in the week."Notwithstanding the suspension of the [High Court Judge Neil] Tuchten order and full knowledge of the SCA petition, the RTMC unlawfully stormed and seized control of the premises," Tasima said in a statement.Security and tensions at the eNatis premises in Midrand were high on Thursday, with Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi expected to address former staff later in the day.Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi said on Thursday the eNatis system was fully operational, and that the takeover had been effected.The sheriff of the High Court had led this process on Wednesday, and the department would continue to work with Tasima. The company had a right to pursue its legal rights, but added "I believe as government we have exhausted the legal channels".The rejected appeal had meant to bring to a close four years of legal battles that saw some 22 legal applications about the system. The RTMC began immediately receiving access to the system on Wednesday.Tasima had returned to court seeking to appeal Monday s ruling that codes, keys and access to the premises be handed over to the RTMC. This was rejected by Judge Tuchten, who c thatoncluded access to the system could be given within 24 hours and any other outstanding issues related to the hand-over addressed in an ongoing manner.The Constitutional Court ruled in November that the system must be handed over within 30 days. The court had further found RTMC officials to be in contempt for failing to abide by previous lower court orders to in favour of Tasima. The Constitutional Court overturned these, but concluded orders must be complied with until they are overturned.Tasima interpreted the judgment as a 30-day window to establish a rational migration plan for a sensitive and complex system, saying a "precipitous hand-over" could compromise the system.
