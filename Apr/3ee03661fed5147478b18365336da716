A stay of execution of up to 90 days from credit ratings agency Moody’s appears to have calmed the rand, which was trading at about R13.64/$ at 7am on Wednesday morning. Moody’s, which was scheduled to release its review of SA’s sovereign credit rating on Friday, said on Tuesday it had decided to consider its decision for between 30 and 90 days. Moody’s has been the kindest to SA of the big three international credit rating agencies. Until September 2012, Moody’s rated SA A3 and has held this country’s credit ratings two steps above junk since November 2014. S&P Global Ratings, which reduced SA’s credit rating to just one step above junk in December 2014, lost patience with President Jacob Zuma’s administration on Monday, cutting SA to junk. Fitch tends to track S&P, and is expected to also cut its rating to junk in the near future. The extent to which JSE-listed companies have diversified geographically has been revealed by how the overall market has benefited from a falling rand, although banks and other financial institutions suffered. The JSE’s all share index rose 0.39% on Tuesday and 0.77% on Monday, with its gold mining index clocking up nearly 4% gains for three consecutive trading days. The index has gained 12.2% since March 30. Its platinum mining index jumped 5% on Tuesday, led by Northam, which gained 7.19% to R56.23, followed by Impala, which rose 4.77% to R48.50, and Anglo American Platinum, which rose 4.65% to R322.80. The JSE’s banking index, in contrast, has had a torrid week, losing 6.4% since March 30. Markets trading ahead of the JSE’s opening on Wednesday morning were slightly firmer. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.16% and Sydney’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.17%. Shanghai reopened after a two-day holiday with a 1.1% surge.
