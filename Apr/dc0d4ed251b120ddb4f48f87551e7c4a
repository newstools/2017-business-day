Suspended ANC Western Cape chairman Marius Fransman is fighting to retain his position in the party and has vowed to petition its national executive committee (NEC) to review the national disciplinary committee’s (NDC’s) decision to confirm his suspension. In what could signal the end of his career in the ANC, the NDC on Thursday confirmed its previous decision that Fransman was guilty of misconduct and should be suspended from the party for five years. The NDC had found Fransman guilty of misconduct after an ANC office worker, Louisa Wynand, accused of him of sexual harassment. He was also charged with making public statements that brought the ANC into disrepute. Fransman subsequently appealed against the decision to the disciplinary committee of appeal, raising technicalities.
