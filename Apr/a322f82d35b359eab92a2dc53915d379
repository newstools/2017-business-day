Policy uncertainty went up in the first quarter of 2017 based on the Cabinet reshuffle and the economic consequences. The policy uncertainty index (PUI) released on Thursday by the North West University (NWU) School of Business and Governance, shows an average score of 51.0, up from 38.8 in the fourth quarter of 2016, putting the index in negative territory.An increase to above 50 reflects heightened policy uncertainty, while a score below 50 indicates reduced uncertainty.The index shows that the media talked more about policy uncertainty in SA, while economists unanimously agreed that policy uncertainty had risen. The index draws on sentiment from both local and international investors and while the global economy is recovering, SA has "performed far less well". According to the index, "Economic activity in most sectors proved much weaker in the earlier part of 2017 than many analysts expected."Prof Raymond Parsons said: "The PIU confirms that SA is facing a period of uncertainty, the replacement of [finance] minister [Pravin] Gordhan has enhanced that uncertainty."He added that while the Cabinet reshuffle was partially priced-in by the markets, it has a potentially wide economic impact and has caused the PUI to spike sharply again. "A wait-and-see environment is expensive for investors right now," said Parsons.The index notes that radical economic transformation is an important new source of policy uncertainty and National Treasury and Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba will need to win back investor confidence. It adds that while Gigaba has said fiscal policy will remain the same, it was still a concern: "The real test of fiscal management will be reflected in the medium-term budget policy statement in October to see whether any fiscal shocks emerge."
