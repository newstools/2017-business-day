Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba sets off on an international road show this week in a bid to restore confidence in SA Inc after two bruising ratings downgrades. Gigaba will have his first opportunity to meet his global counterparts at the IMF/World Bank Spring meetings, which open in Washington DC on Friday. He will then meet investors in Boston and New York and will also meet ratings agency Moody’s, which has SA on watch for a downgrade. However, Gigaba will not be accompanied by any of the high-profile business leaders who have in the past year typically accompanied government on road shows to investors and ratings agencies, helping to avert downgrades in 2016.
