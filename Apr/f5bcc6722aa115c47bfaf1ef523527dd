The ANC will on Wednesday morning announce the outcome of a critical extended national working committee meeting (NWC) as calls for President Jacob Zuma to resign grow. The meeting concluded late on Monday but committee member Nomvula Mokonyane stepped out to address the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) in Germiston and proclaimed that Zuma "is not leaving office until 2019". Notes released, ostensibly by accident, by the ANC’s own e-mail account to the media indicated a fight back by Zuma’s allies in the meeting calling on Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize and secretary-general Gwede Mantashe to apologise for criticising his reshuffle last week. The notes also criticised ministers for their conduct at the funeral of late stalwart Ahmed Kathrada and referred to the "mobilising " by former finance minister Pravin Gordhan. The ANC, however, distanced itself from the notes in a separate media release, saying they did not represent the party’s views. Provincial chairs and secretaries were called in to attend the meeting on Tuesday after a lengthy officials meeting on Monday. The integrity commission urged Zuma to step down in the Monday meeting. Ally Cosatu also called on Zuma to step down on Tuesday, as well as the party veterans. Cosatu general secretary Bheki Nthsalintshali announced at a media briefing that the federation’s top brass had taken a decision to call on him to step down — among the reasons was his failure to consult the federation on the reshuffle. It is understood that only three unions, one of which was not in good standing, had opposed the decision taken at a special central executive committee meeting on Monday. Zuma allies are fighting back against the tide of criticism Zuma faced in the wake of the reshuffle, which also resulted in S&P Global Ratings downgrading the country’s credit rating to junk status.
