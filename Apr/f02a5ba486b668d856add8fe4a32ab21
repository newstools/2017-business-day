The Judicial Service Commission (JSC) was due to begin with a round of interviews to fill 11 vacant positions within the superior courts, on Monday. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng was expected to chair the interviews‚ held at his offices in Midrand. Among those on the panel of interviewers was EFF leader Julius Malema, and Thoko Didiza‚ who was the ANC’s mayoral candidate for Tshwane. First on the list to face the panel was Judge Raymond Zondo‚ who is currently serving as a Constitutional Court judge. Zondo was being interviewed with the hope of succeeding retired Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke. Bess Nkabinde is currently acting in the position. Her 12-year term comes to an end on December 31‚ making her ineligible for the post. President Jacob Zuma has recommended Zondo for the post. Zondo’s appointment to the Constitutional Court five years ago was met with reports that he had always been Zuma’s favoured candidate for the post. Zondo rejected the claims. TMG Digital
