Boxing legend George Foreman says Britain’s Anthony Joshua is his favourite to win April’s clash of the heavyweight giants against Wladimir Klitschko. "If I were a gambler, I’d see Joshua as a 6-5 favourite. So I’d put him just in front," the 68-year-old Foreman told German magazine Sport Bild. Londoner Joshua will fight Hamburg-based Klitschko at Wembley Stadium on April 29 with the WBA ‘Super’, IBF, and IBO world heavyweight titles on the line. Joshua, 27, the 2012 London Olympic champion, has won all of his 18 professional bouts so far, but Foreman, a former two-time world heavyweight champion, says Klitschko provides his "first real test". "Klitschko knows how to win and how to use his body size. It will be a difficult fight," said Foreman, who lost to Muhammad Ali in the 1974 "Rumble in the Jungle" bout. At 41, Klitschko is bidding to be world heavyweight champion again, having lost his belts to Britain’s Tyson Fury — his first defeat in a decade — in November 2015. "If he wins the world title again — oh my God, imagine that!" said Foreman. Foreman knows all about being world champion again in your 40s. He set the record for the world’s oldest heavyweight champion — 45 years, 299 days — when he knocked out Michael Moorer in 1994. "I am convinced there will be a heavyweight who will surpass my record, because us heavy guys depend on our impact, but there is always a 45 or 46-year-old somewhere in the world who can really punch." Foreman said that he has not stopped boxing and still spars in the gym from time to time. AFP
