The JSE all share closed weaker on Friday in the shortened trading week following the Easter weekend‚ with broad-based losses as platinums retreated and general retailers failed to capitalise on a stronger rand. Volumes were low with the values of trade at R10bn at the close‚ from R19bn on Thursday. Sentiment was cautious ahead of the French elections over the weekend following another terrorist attack in Paris in which a French policeman was killed. "The jitters in the French elections were accelerated by the shooting in Paris on Thursday night‚ and as polls show centrist Emmanuel Macron beating the far-right‚ anti-EU Marine Le Pen‚" said TreasuryOne dealer Phillip Pearce. "The elections are close‚ and if we learnt anything from last year‚ polls have a large room for error." The stronger rand played havoc with the market during the week‚ as miners and rand hedges felt the full effect of the stronger local currency‚ which gained 2% to the dollar. Normally the stronger rand would support local banks and retailers‚ but both sectors were under pressure in the week amid tepid growth expectations for the rest of the year. The IMF has lowered GDP growth expectations for the local economy to 0.8% this year. The all share ended the week 2.46% lower‚ which marks its steepest weekly decline since December. According to recent polls the medium forecast for the probability of a recession in SA rose sharply in April‚ to 45%‚ from 20% in March. "The recent political noise and credit ratings downgrades have turned the market increasingly bearish on growth and hawkish on inflation and interest rate trends‚" analysts at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking said.
