Seasonally adjusted mining production increased by 2.9% in February 2017 compared with January 2017, while it decreased by 1.6% in the three months ended February 2017 compared with the previous three months. Diamonds, which contributed one percentage point had, the biggest drag. Seasonally adjusted mineral sales at current prices decreased by 3.2% in January 2017 to R33bn compared with R41.7bn in December 2016.
