The South African bond market was weaker on Tuesday afternoon while the rand continued to regain some strength. The local currency strengthened to R13.27 to the dollar in earlier trade after the Easter weekend. Bonds usually track the rand. Rand Merchant Bank analyst John Cairns said with continued flows into emerging markets and a weaker dollar, the rand continued to regain lost ground. On Thursday, the R186 was below 8.80%, with local investors being better buyers overall, albeit in very light trade. "Hopefully this demand will continue today as we have the weekly government auction to contend with straight after the Easter weekend," he said. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba sets off on an international road show this week to try restore investor confidence in SA, after it was downgrade to "junk" status by two ratings agencies. At 11.28, the bid on the benchmark R186 was at 8.85%, from 8.81% on Thursday, and the R207 was at 7.745% from 7.685%. Friday and Monday were public holidays.
