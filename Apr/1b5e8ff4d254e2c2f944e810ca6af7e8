The rand was weaker against a firmer dollar before midday on Thursday, as the dollar recovered from the previous day's losses. On Wednesday, the local currency gained 2.64%, strengthening to R13.6424 to the dollar due to various factors, including the market’s reaction to US President Donald Trump’s comment that he was in favour of the US Federal Reserve keeping interest rates low. The dollar then fell against most major currencies late on Wednesday. Intensified calls for President Jacob Zuma to step down and the Constitutional Court allowing parties to file opposing motions of no confidence in him, also came into play. Before midday, the local currency had lost 0.33% to the greenback. Analysts at Vestact said the weakness now comes as a result of the combined dollar strength and local issues. At 11.51am‚ the rand was at R13.5335 to the dollar from R13.4894; R14.4000 to the euro from R14.3834; and at R16.9746 to the pound from R16.9032. The euro was at $1.0639 from $1.0663.
