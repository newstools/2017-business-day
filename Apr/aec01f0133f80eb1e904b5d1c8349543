The JSE opened higher on Monday with a firmer bias as banks and retailers rebounded on the stronger rand. Miners, notably gold and platinum stocks, lost ground in early morning trade in a global relief rally following the electoral victory of pro-EU French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron in the first round of voting over the weekend, pipping right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen at the post. The French CAC 40 jumped 3.65% and the German Dax 30 added 2.39% at the opening. The FTSE 100 rose 1.71%. The stronger European markets followed on a firm showing in Asia, with the Nikkei 225 rising 1.37%. The Hang Seng was up 0.46%. The Dow Jones ended the Friday session 0.15% lower. The rand firmed to R12.92/$ in early morning trade after the dollar slumped to $1.0935 to the euro at the weekend. At 9.40am the all share was 0.34% higher at 52,372.10 points and the blue-chip top 40 added 0.36%. Banks rose 2.15% and general retailers were up 1.65%. Financials added 1.35% and property jumped 1.02%. The gold index plummeted 6.45% and platinums shed 3.27%. Resources were off 1.37%. Banks have been under pressure on the initial weakening of the rand following the double downgrades by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch earlier in April, but have gradually edged up higher as the rand recovered, with the index gaining 2.4% last week. However, local banks still faced short-, medium-and longer-term risks, centred on top-line growth in a lower growth environment, said Ashburton Investments banking analyst Nkareng Mpobane. "Recent price weakness suggested that banks were attractively priced at present, with no dividend cuts expected," Mpobane said. Sasol lost 1.62% to R391.01. Kumba Iron Ore shed 4.26% to R176.88. Gold Fields tumbled 7.80% to R46.82. Harmony shed 7.54% to R28.69. Barclays Africa rose 2.61% to R148.14 and Standard Bank added 2.48% to R146.70. Among financials Sanlam jumped 2.35% to R69.60. Among retailers Massmart lifted 2.17% to R131.29. Woolworths rose 1.99% to R73.22. Redefine rallied 2.30% to R11.10 in the property sector and Resilient was up 1.67% to R115.98.
