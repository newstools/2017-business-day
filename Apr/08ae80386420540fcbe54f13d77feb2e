Sibanye Gold has cleared the final US regulatory hurdle in its $2.2bn takeover of palladium and platinum miner Stillwater Mining and will later this month seek approval from its shareholders for the all-cash deal and a $1bn rights issue. Sibanye, which has bought two platinum assets in SA, the world s largest source of mined platinum, last year unveiled a bid for the whole of the only North American platinum group metal miner, which will give it mining, processing and recycling facilities outside SA. Sibanye said it had received unconditional approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment into the US for the takeover of Stillwater, which will thrust Sibanye into the top league of global platinum group metal producers. All regulatory conditions required for the implementation of the transaction have now been satisfied. The transaction remains subject to the approval of the shareholders of Stillwater and Sibanye, the company said.Sibanye shareholders will meet on April 25 to vote for the deal and to approve the issue of shares to contribute funding towards the purchase of Stillwater, the directors of which have given their backing for the deal. A syndicate of 16 local and international banks and financial institutions have provided Sibanye with a $2.65bn loan facility. Sibanye said on Tuesday it had decided it would raise $1bn in a rights issue, which is lower than the $1.3bn it had recently suggested but in line with the $750m-$1bn it had proposed when it announced the deal last year. It will secure another $1bn in the debt market and most likely via a bond issue. The $2bn raised in the first half of this year will go towards repaying the bridging loan from the financial institutions.Sibanye will raise the balance by either a streaming arrangement which essentially entails securing cash up front from a third party in exchange for part or all of future metal production or bank debt, convertible bonds or a rights issue before the end of this year.
