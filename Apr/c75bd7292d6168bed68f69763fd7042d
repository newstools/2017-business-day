Probably the best bet at Saturday s Turffontein meeting is that trainer Sean Tarry will be receiving the Empress Club trophy from Princess Charlene of Monaco.She will be the star attraction at the city track and as usual charities will benefit from her involvement with the meeting.Tarry approaching the R20m mark in stake earnings for his horses this term will saddle five runners in Saturday s grade1 race over 1,600m.Most pundits are backing S manga Khumalo s mount, Safe Harbour, as their pick of the Tarry quintet and World Sports Betting quote the filly as the favourite at 4-1. Nevertheless, the each-way value and a possible swinger wager with Safe Harbour could be stablemate, Trophy Wife.Leading apprentice Lyle Hewitson will have been delighted to get the call to partner Trophy Wife, who is at 25-1 in early betting on the Vodacom Durban July.Mike de Kock s runner Nother Russia, surprisingly on offer at 10-1 for the Empress Club, has to be on the short-list of possible winners with last season s Wilgerbosdrift Fillies Classic heroine, Juxtapose.Fort Ember has been in top form in 2017 and trainer Paul Peter has engaged the services of Anton Marcus to ride his filly in this grade1 contest.Interestingly, a full-sister to Safe Harbour and half-sister to another Tarry runner, Intergalactic, will be offered at Friday evening s CTS Select Yearling Sale at Emperors Palace.Summerhill Stud will be offering a half-sister (by Visionaire) to Intergalactic and Highlands Farm will be selling a full-sister to Safe Harbour, named Saints Alive.Tarry should enjoy another successful meeting and he holds a strong hand in the fifth race with Count Tassilo and Prospect Strike.Jackman took forever to leave the maiden ranks but Brian Wiid has his team in hot form and the gelding can go well for young Callan Murray in the eighth race.
