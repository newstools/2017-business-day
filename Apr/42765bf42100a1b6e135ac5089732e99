The total revenue from SA s hotels, guest houses and other tourist accommodation totalled R3.99bn in February, Statistics SA reported on Tuesday.This was 3.6% higher than the same month in 2016.The December holidays led to the tourist accommodation industry s revenue peaking at R4.5bn, and then tapering off to R3.9bn in January.Surprisingly, February s occupancy rate was 55.9%, higher than December s 53.6%. The extra income the industry enjoyed in December came from what Statistics SA classifies as "other" rather than from renting rooms and selling food and drink.Statistics SA defines "other income" as money from casino gambling, laundry and telephone services, rentals and fees received for transport services, offices, shops, garages, and so forth.In February, the industry earned 53% of its income from accommodation, 31% from "other" and 16% from restaurant and bar sales.In December, accommodation accounted for 51% of the total, "other" for 33% and food and drink for 16%.Statistics SA s data, which goes back to 2017, shows the industry s total income rocketed to R3.6bn in June 2010 from about R2.3bn in the months leading up to the Fifa soccer world cup. The tourist accommodation industry only cracked R3.6bn again in August 2015.Statistics SA reports tourist accommodation income in current rand, so this comparison does not take inflation into account.The soccer world cup also resulted in the average price per night jumping to R982 from about R600. Statistics SA s data shows the nightly tourist accommodation bill has averaged more than R1,000 since December 2015, reaching R1,086 in February.Of February s total income, 78% was earned by hotels, 17% by what Statistics SA classifies as "other accommodation", about 5% by guest houses and guest farms and a sliver (R15.3m) went to caravan parks.
