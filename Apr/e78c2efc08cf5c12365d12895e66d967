Rockwell Diamonds, which is suspended from trade in Johannesburg and Toronto, has filed for business rescue to stave off attempts by a contractor to liquidate the company. Rockwell had an interim liquidation order awarded against it in March by a judge in a Kimberley court after which it applied for trade in its shares to be suspended. Rockwell argued that the judge did not consider its arguments in hearing the liquidation case brought against its three subsidiaries by C-Rock Mining and has asked that the final hearing, set down for June, be brought forward on an urgent basis. "The interim order was issued after a short hearing where none of the company’s rebuttal evidence was considered by the court," Rockwell said. "The company remains persuaded that its case for dismissal of the liquidation application is sound, and after a full hearing it believes it should prevail and C-Rock Mining’s actions will be shown to be spurious and without foundation." Interim liquidators have been appointed but have not taken over any management roles while the legal process continues, the company added. To prevent the liquidation of Rockwell, management has filed an application to put it into business rescue and give its strategy to turn the loss-making company to profit a chance of success. "If successful in its application for business rescue, a business rescue practitioner will be appointed to work with management to restructure the affairs of the company, seeking input and consent from creditors, as well as considering strategic alternatives," Rockwell said, noting that nearly all its creditors supported its turnaround strategy. The new plan includes the injection of $8m into Rockwell to complete the new Wouterspan processing plant, selling assets, paying all creditors owed R50,000 or less, and only buying supplies for cash: "The implementation of this business plan is well advanced, despite the frustrating intervention by C-Rock Mining."
