The Blitzboks then needed an extra-time try scored by Ruhan Nel to overcome a spirited US 29-24 in the semifinal to make the Hong Kong final.It was the fourth time in history that SA had made the final of the most prestigious tournament on the circuit two had also been against Fiji and the other against New Zealand but yet again, they could not cross the line first.The physicality and speed of Fiji the reigning series champions and current Olympic champions was just too much for the Blitzboks.SA was also punished for their numerous handling and passing errors.TMG Digital
