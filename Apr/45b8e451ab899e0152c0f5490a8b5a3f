Former deputy minister of finance Mcebisi Jonas and former energy minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson have resigned as ANC MPs, Parliament confirmed on Thursday. Their resignations follow that of former transport minister Dipuo Peters.  Peters resigned as MP after she lost her job to Joe Maswanganyi following President Jacob Zuma’s controversial midnight Cabinet reshuffle last week. The reshuffle saw Pravin Gordhan and Jonas get fired as finance minister and deputy finance minister respectively, which sent the rand and markets into a tailspin. Joemat-Pettersson was also removed as energy minister then. “The office of the ANC chief whip confirms the resignation of former deputy finance minister and ANC MP Cde Mcebisi Jonas as a member of parliament effective March 31,” the ANC chief whip’s spokeswoman Nonceba Mhlauli said. “Comrade Jonas has served both as deputy minister and MP with absolute distinction and dedication. He has also served the movement and the South African people in various capacities over the years. On behalf of the ANC in Parliament we thank comrade Jonas for his selfless service to the movement as its public representative. We are confident that he will continue serving the country and our movement in other capacities in future. We wish him well,” said Mhlauli. Anti-Zuma protests are gaining momentum throughout the country with civil society organisations and the DA planning to take to the streets to protest against the Cabinet reshuffle. A nationwide protest is planned for Friday amid increasing calls for the president to step down. Zuma’s decision to sack Gordhan and Jonas has been cited as one of the reasons why ratings agency S&P decided to downgrade SA to sub-investment grade or junk status.
