The High Court in Pretoria on Wednesday rejected a request by Tasima for leave to appeal a judgment ordering them to hand over control of the Electronic National Traffic Information System (eNatis).The rejected appeal brings to a close four years of legal battles that included about 22 legal applications over the system. Control of the system is expected to be handed over to the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) on Wednesday.Tasima had returned to court seeking to appeal Monday s ruling that codes, keys and access to the premises be handed over to the RTMC.Tasima s legal counsel, Paul McNally SC, said a court may come to a different conclusion on the matter, which had required the interpretation of a 2016 Constitutional Court judgment.This was rejected by Judge Neil Tuchtens, who said the application lacked reasonable grounds for success.The Constitutional Court ruled in November that the system should be handed over within 30 days, which Tasima interpreted as a 30-day window to establish a rational migration plan for a sensitive and complex system."The public interest is not protected by a precipitous handover," McNally said.RTMC CEO Makhosini Msibi said on Thursday that the corporation was ready to assume control of the system immediately. Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi would hold a briefing on this on Thursday, he said.
