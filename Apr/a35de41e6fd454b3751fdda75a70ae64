The South African bond market was weaker on Thursday morning but remained resilient despite the ongoing political tension. The benchmark R186 government bond has made attempts to close above the 9% since the beginning of the week but foreigners continued to find value in the local market. TreasuryOne currency dealer Phillip Pearce said bond purchases were creating an unexpected great run that had been spurred on by recovering commodity prices and renewed interest in emerging markets. In an unexpected turn of events on Wednesday, the ANC’s national working committee backed President Jacob Zuma’s decision to reshuffle the Cabinet, which led to S&P Global Ratings downgrading the country’s credit rating to subinvestment grade. Pearce said that as local issues started to settle, the local market would "catch further onto the coattails of the global winds and a move lower is on the cards". At 9am the bid on the R186 was at 9.030% from Thursday’s 8.990% and that of the R207 at 7.830% from 7.815%.
