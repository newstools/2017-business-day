Food inflation is moderating as the effects of a long, severe drought have eased in many parts of the country.Excluding beverages, food prices also rose 8.7% in March from a year earlier, after February s 10% increase.CPI has spend most of the past year outside the Reserve Bank s 3%-6% target range, and could head higher in April, after the rand took a knock from President Jacob Zuma s Cabinet reshuffle.Fuel prices, another key driver of inflation, rose 15% year on year in March but fell 0.4%. Petrol prices rose 29c a litre in February, but fell again in March, by 8c/l.An incrase of more than 50c is expected for April, however, and motorists are also having to digest higher fuel and Road Accident Fund levies.

These took effect on April 1, and their effects will be seen in the next CPI release.Compared with a month earlier, CPI rose 0.6% in March.
