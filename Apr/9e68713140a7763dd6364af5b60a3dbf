The Competition Tribunal’s decision to further investigate the sale of a unit of accounting group PwC, Combined Systems, to EOH’s subsidiary Mthombo, sent the computer group’s share down 3.5% to R126.74 on Thursday morning. The Tribunal said on Wednesday that it wanted additional information before deciding if it would permit the deal to proceed without conditions. A reason for the Tribunal’s concern was the two companies operated in the "the provision of fixed asset management services" market, which might suffer too much concentration if Mthombo took over PwC’s unit. "The acquiring group [EOH] provides services and products in consulting, technology such as software and infrastructure and outsourcing," the Tribunal said in Wednesday’s statement. EOH has not issued a cautionary statement regarding the proposed acquisition, as would be required if the deal were "material", which is generally defined as likely to cause a 10% change in its share price. "PwC Combined Systems is controlled by PwC Incorporated. Combined Systems is a fixed-asset management and assets tracking business, offering asset accounting and compliance and asset lifecycle management services to public-and private-sector customers," the Tribunal said.
