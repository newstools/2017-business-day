The JSE all share opened firmer on Monday, topping the 53,000 points level for the first time since end-January, as resources gained on the weaker rand. The rand dropped 1% to R13.98/$ in early morning trade following Fitchâ€™s junk status downgrade on Friday. Gold stocks were lower on a stronger dollar. The greenback recorded gains on Friday, despite nonfarm payroll data disappointing, as the US Federal Reserve remained committed to two further interest rate hikes this year. Local banks and general retailers were under pressure, with property picking up marginally after the index lost 2.25% last week. "The life assurance sector, retail shares, financial counters and banks were much oversold and some bargain hunting could be expected," analysts at Momentum SP Reid said.
