Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has appointed Lt-Gen Yolisa Matakata as the acting head of the Hawks.This after a full bench of the High Court in Pretoria dismissed Ntlemeza s application for leave to appeal against an earlier ruling that found his appointment to be invalid.He was fired with immediate effect.Matakata is the deputy head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), or the Hawks.Ntlemeza was appointed head of the Hawks in December 2014 by then police minister Nathi Nhleko.The Helen Suzman Foundation and Freedom Under Law brought an application for Ntlemeza s appointment to be declared irrational and unlawful and set aside asking the court to refer the appointment back to a selection panel for a new candidate to be chosen.On Thursday, Mbalula said he expected society and members of the Hawks to rally behind Matakata. He said he had also decided to withdraw the application for leave to appeal against the Court's decision on Ntlemeza's appointment, saying there was little chance of success. This left Ntlemeza to appeal in his personal capacity.Mbalula said he was expected to act in the best interests of the Hawks and guard against wasteful expenditure."What is expected from all of us is to fight crime and corruption. We want the Hawks to spare no one, irrespective of their status in society. I m concerned about the current arrests; we are not hitting our target in fighting crime. We should reach those targets in the near future," he said.He said the DPCI had to guard against the perception that it was a useless unit.Mbalula said he had reminded members of senior management that their job was to fight crime, irrespective of who committed it, whether it was in the public-or private sector, and regardless of people's political affiliation.The Hawks needed to inspire confidence, he said."The DPCI must be an armed, elite unit that is clinical in the way it executes its work. Therefore, I have instructed those who feel they are not equal to the task to jump ship," he said.The minister said the Hawks unit was not in crisis or a state of emergency, and that it would regroup.
