Bengaluru Gold prices held firm on Thursday after falling as much as 1% the previous day, with tension surrounding North Korea and the upcoming French presidential election driving safe-haven demand amid a firmer dollar.Spot gold was mostly unchanged at $1,278.64/oz at 3.46am GMT. The metal fell 0.8% on Wednesday in its worst one-day drop in more than a month."Sentiment overall is that everybody is looking for $1,300 at least by the end of the week. Sentiment around geopolitical issues is really playing on people s minds," said Spencer Campbell, general manager with Kaloti Precious Metals in Singapore."We are seeing a lot more physical purchasing, with shops seeing a 100% increase in buying from the retail sector," said Campbell."This clearly shows the pull back is an opportunity [to buy gold before it climbs above $1,300]."Analysts and traders said gold would be supported by simmering geopolitical tension around North Korea and nervousness ahead of the first round of France s presidential election."With this weekend s French presidential vote event risk, it is hard to see gold forming a meaningful correction to the downside before next week at the earliest," said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda. "Safe-haven buying should continue to support any dips."Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), rose 1.39% on Wednesday, their biggest one-day gain since early September 2016.Holdings climbed nearly 12 tonnes from Tuesday to 860.76 tonnes.Meanwhile, spot silver gained 0.2% to $18.11.
