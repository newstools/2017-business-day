The South African bond market was little changed on Thursday morning, suggesting a degree caution before key announcements from central banks. The South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee will announce its decision on interest rates later in the day. The Bank is under pressure to cut rates, given the moderation in inflation. Headline inflation, which the Bank closely monitors in its rate-setting policy, slowed to an annual rate of 5.1% in June, its lowest level since 2015, prompting some economists to expect loose monetary policy as early this afternoon. But the dominant view is that Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago would hold fire for now, given the volatility of the rand exchange rate, which analysts say poses a potential risk to the outlook on inflation. Rand Merchant Bank analyst Gordhan Kerr said: "Any confirmation that a rate cut is … imminent should provide further fuel for our bonds to rally." Local bonds have benefited from the recent pick-up in global risk appetite, which also boosted the fortunes of the rand. Markets will also keep a watchful eye on the outcome of the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) policy meeting, after which president Mario Draghi could announce plans to taper the bank’s stimulus programme. "The risk today comes if Draghi puts his dovish hat on and suggests the [stimulus] programme could simply be extended in its current form," Oanda senior market analyst said in a note. The programme will expire at the end of year. Earlier in the day the Bank of Japan (BoJ) announced it had kept its monetary policy steady. The yield on the benchmark was at 8.640% in early trade, from 8.645%.
