The Department of Education wants to drop maths as a compulsory subject for pupils studying accounting until matric. The department has gazetted the proposed change to the Schools Act for public comment. Anyone interested in the potential change can send comments to the department by August 4. Department of Education spokesman Troy Martens said feedback from parents‚ teachers and pupils revealed that many pupils who did not want to study pure maths still had an interest in accounting. "In a number of engagements with teachers and parents‚ [they said] learners don’t want to take pure maths‚ but still want to take accounting." The restriction stopping pupils who study maths literacy from choosing accounting as a matric subject is "stifling the opportunities of learners"‚ said Martens. She explained that there were professions in administration‚ marketing and bookkeeping that used accounting but did not require advanced maths skills. Martens said if pupils wanted to study a BComm degree in accounting, or degrees in finance and taxation‚ they would still need to study maths. The proposal does not change university entry requirements for business and chartered accounting degrees. Before the curriculum changed in 2011‚ learners could choose accounting as a matric subject without studying maths.
