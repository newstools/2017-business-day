The JSE all share opened strongly firmer on Tuesday — one of the best openings in days, as the weaker rand boosted rand hedges and miners. The bourse was also following higher Asian markets, with the Hang Seng up 1.56% and the Nikkei 225 0.57% higher. The Dow closed flat (-0.03%) at 21,408.52 on Monday. The rand lost 1% in early trade to R13.61/$, the weakest level in two months. The rand has now lost 3.8% to the greenback in July after starting trading at a level of R13/$ at the beginning of the month. Earlier comments by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, in which she backtracked on her proposal to change the constitutional mandate of the Reserve Bank, should have theoretically supported the local currency. However, decisions emanating from the ANC’s policy conference last week have put the rand under pressure again, more so as it was not in response to a firmer dollar, which has remained fairly stable against the euro ahead of further envisaged rate hikes in the US. "Comments regarding the wish to have the control of the budget moved to the Office of the President brought rand gains on Monday to a rapid halt, and thereafter the local unit traded on the back foot," analysts at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) said. The suggestions for the budget to be under the control of the Presidency date back to an announcement in March by Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe. He said the Presidency should be the "strategic centre of power" in the government, controlling policy direction and resource allocation, including the budget. The plan had been discussed at the policy conference and would now be debated at branches for possible adoption at the ANC national conference in December. In further clarification, ANC officials said on Monday that the Treasury would remain independent but would have to align the budget with the country’s plans, outlined in President Jacob Zuma’s state of the nation address and the National Development Plan. The all share immediately reacted favourably to the weaker rand and at 9.33am it was up 1.07% to 52,748.20 points. The blue-chip top 40 rose 1.25%, mainly on Naspers. Resources gained 2.56% and the gold index 2.14% on a weaker gold price. Industrials added 1.16% and platinums 0.85%. General retailers lost 0.87%, banks 0.52% and property 0.47%. Naspers was the early morning mover, jumping 3.28% to R2,600.05. The group earlier announced that it was selling its stake in a Turkish online retailer, Markafoni.com. Naspers closed 1.7% higher on Monday, contributing more than half of the 306-points move on the top 40, which recorded gains for the first time since Wednesday last week. Among the global miners Anglo American leapt 4.27% to R192.20. BHP rose 3.24% to R224.45. Sasol rebounded 1.24% to R371.53 on a higher Brent crude, which rose 0.26% to $47.11 a barrel in early trade. Among the rand hedges Richemont gained 1.38% to R110.11 and British American Tobacco 0.44% to R904.62. Sibanye Gold rose 3.03% to R15.66. Anglo American Platinum was up 1.35% to R303.08.
