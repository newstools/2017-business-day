Athletics SA has named two B qualifiers in its preliminary team for the World Championships in London in August but omitted 17 others who are still trying to achieve the federation’s tough A standards. Women’s marathon runners Mapaseka Makhanya and Jenna Challenor achieved the International Association of Athletics Federations’ qualifying time of 2hr 45min‚ but both were well short of Athletics SA’s 2:28:48 A standard. At least 17 other track and field athletes have achieved the association’s standards but not Athletics SA’s more stringent A criteria. Athletics SA president Aleck Skhosana explained that appeals could be lodged before the team was finalised after the qualifying window closed on July 23. In a circular sent to members‚ Athletics SA also said the men’s 4x100m relay team was on track to qualify for the showpiece because they were ranked seventh in the world. There are 16 spots available for London — the top eight teams from World Relays in Bahamas qualified automatically and the next eight must qualify on fastest times dating back to January 1 2016. While SA is ranked seventh in the world for 2017‚ it slips to ninth once the times from 2016 are factored in. Men: Akani Simbine (100m‚ 200m)‚ Thando Roto (100m)‚ Wayde van Niekerk (200m‚ 400m)‚ Clarence Munyai (200m)‚ Ncincilili Titi (200m)‚ Lusapho April (marathon)‚ Sibusiso Nzima (marathon)‚ Desmond Mokgobo (marathon)‚ Antonio Alkana (110m hurdles)‚ Luvo Manyonga (long jump)‚ Ruswahl Samaai (long jump)‚ Zarck Visser (long jump)‚ Khotso Mokoena (long jump)‚ Orazio Cremona (shot put)‚ Jaco Engelbrecht (shot put)‚ Rocco van Rooyen (javelin).
