The JSE opened firmer in risk-on trade on Thursday, crossing the 55,000-point level for the first time in more than two years on the Federal Reserve’s mildly dovish stance, which implied a more gradual approach to lifting US interest rates. The Fed kept rates unchanged, as expected, but changed two phrases in its statement, which the market has interpreted as meaning that the rate-increase process will be more gradual than previously thought. The Fed said the planned balance sheet rundown would take place "relatively soon" from a previous "soon", while the 2% inflation target was changed to "around 2%", giving the central bank some leeway to react to the reality of subdued consumer inflation pressure in the US. "Asian stocks have risen to the highest levels in almost a decade as markets bet that the Fed will leave rates unchanged in the short term," said TreasuryOne dealer Phillip Pearce. Pearce said it was unsurprising that the Fed held rates steady while inflation remained persistently low despite the economy picking up steam. The Nikkei 225 rose 0.15% and the Hang Seng was 0.79% higher. US markets surged on the Fed stance, with the Dow closing up 0.45% at a record 21,711.01 points on Wednesday. Boeing was largely responsible for the run, rocketing more than 9% after returning to profit in the second quarter and raising its outlook. US equities closed higher due to upbeat earnings and the Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged for the moment, Momentum SP Reid analysts said. "While the Fed kept policy moderately steady as anticipated, the central bank did, however, lay out the groundwork for winding down its balance sheet relatively soon." That could be as soon as September, Nedbank analysts said. Upbeat results from Anglo American and Anheuser-Busch InBev, and Naspers hitting another high also supported the local market. Glencore, ArcelorMittal, MTN and Intu Properties were down on disappointing results or trading updates. At 9.30am the all share was up 0.40% to 55,053.60 points after having reached 55,222.80 at the opening, only about 100 points below its previous high of 55,355.10, which it reached on April 24 2015.

Kumba Iron Ore was off 0.11% to R193.79. ArcelorMittal shed 2.60% to R4.87. The group said revenue was up 12.6% to R19.1bn in the six months to end-June, partly offset by lower sales volumes. Global beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev rose 4.74% to R1,572.97 after announcing revenue grew 5% in the second quarter, with revenue per hectolitre growth of 3.2% for the half year to end-June.
