Protest action in Diepsloot has brought traffic to a near standstill on Monday morning. Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said the R511 should be avoided completely as reinforcement was on its way to redirect traffic. "The R511 is affected between Sandton and Centurion. That road should be avoided completely and the N14 from Krugersdorp is also being affected. More officials are being sent to the scene to direct traffic. Motorists can make use of the N1 as an alternative route this morning‚" said Minnaar. Motorists took to social media to vent their frustration on Monday morning as traffic is completely backed up. MoKwena YaMetsi tweeted: "We are unable to leave Diepsloot‚ all roads closed due to electricity. Can we get someone to address them‚ pls. (N14/R511)" Judith Tladi tweeted: "Chaos in diepsloot ... robots blocked cars taking Mnandi Road." Phungashe Ndaba tweeted: "Diepsloot residents blockading the road on R114 right now east and west bound."
