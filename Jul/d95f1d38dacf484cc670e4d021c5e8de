Allowing the Post Office, via the Postbank, to extend credit is likely to make it yet another state-owned enterprise in need of a hefty bail-out, BMI Research warned in a note on Tuesday. The government recently decided to step up its activity in the banking market by expanding the Post Office’s licence to allow its Postbank subsidiary to offer credit. Historically, Postbank was only permitted to offer savings accounts, not make loans. Although SA scores highly on measures of basic financial inclusion, with 70.3% of the population having access to a bank account, only 12.1% of the population accessed credit through a financial institution as of 2014 data. This is probably a symptom of too little competition in SA’s banking industry, dominated by the "big four" who control 80% of the market. "Competition is limited, encouraging banks to maintain high lending rates. "That said, we see a number of inherent challenges associated with the creation of a new state bank in SA. In the near term, the biggest risk is that the bank will lack the assets to have a significant impact on financial inclusion," the report said. "The Postbank will likely attract far riskier borrowers, suggesting potential for notably weaker average asset quality than commercial banks. In a time of economic strain or exogenous shocks, this could see the government forced to step in with a bail-out. With SA already faced elevated risks of contingent liabilities from the sizeable guarantees to state-owned enterprises, this could risk exacerbating the state’s challenges."
