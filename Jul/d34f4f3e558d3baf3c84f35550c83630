The Stormers go into Saturday’s Super Rugby quarterfinal against the Chiefs with more confidence than they did against the same opponents at the same stage in 2016. Coach Robbie Fleck and captain Siya Kolisi projected quiet conviction that they can win only their second play-off match in nine attempts since 1999 when they meet the two-time champions at Newlands. In 2016 the Chiefs won the corresponding fixture 60-21, but this year the New Zealanders went down 34-26 in a pool match at Newlands. It is that performance and result that has buoyed the Stormers for this encounter. "We’ve forgotten what happened last year and have rather focused on what we did to them this year‚" Kolisi said. "This is a new game and we are a different side to what we were 12 months ago." Fleck named a fit again SP Marais at fullback‚ which means Dillyn Leyds moves to leftwing with Seabelo Senatla dropping to the bench. Up front flank Rynhardt Elstadt starts so Sikhumbuzo Notshe is benched, while reserve prop Steven Kitshoff falls out of the squad altogether as he is not eligible for the post-season‚ having only recently re-joined the Stormers. Marais’ inclusion will bolster the Stormers’ counter-attacking ability, while his accurate goal-kicking could also be a factor. The Stormers have been much improved on attack this season‚ an aspect of their game that adds to their confidence against a team as dangerous as the Chiefs. Defensively‚ though‚ they have struggled at times. "We have conceded 30 tries against NZ teams‚ which was a concern on tour [when the Stormers conceded 24 in three matches] but if you look at our stats at home they are much better‚" Fleck said. "We conceded three tries each against the Chiefs and Blues at home and scored four in both games. It comes down to the same thing against NZ teams – you have to outscore them with tries to win ."
