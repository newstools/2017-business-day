Los Angeles — Marcus Rashford scored twice as Manchester United kicked off their preseason tour of the US with a 5-2 rout of the Los Angeles Galaxy on Saturday. With new signing Romelu Lukaku starting on the bench, young England striker Rashford reminded manager Jose Mourinho of his eye for goal with an energetic display against an outclassed Galaxy team. Rashford opened the scoring after only two minutes and doubled his tally in the 20th minute, latching on to a clever pass from Juan Mata to make it 2-0. Marouane Fellaini put United 3-0 ahead five minutes later, after good work down the left flank by Jesse Lingard. Mourinho changed his entire line-up at half-time, handing a debut to Lukaku. The remainder of the half resembled a training exercise, with United dominating possession against a Galaxy line-up who also made wholesale changes at half-time. On 67 minutes United got their fourth of the night when Anthony Martial burst forward and threaded a pass to Henrikh Mkhitaryan who made no mistake with a confident low strike. Martial made it 5-0 five minutes later, rifling home Timothy Fosu-Mensah’s pullback. The Galaxy bagged two late consolation goals from Giovani dos Santos and Dave Romney. AFP
