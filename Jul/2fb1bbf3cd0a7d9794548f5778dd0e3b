The JSE opened firmer on Tuesday as resources rebounded, led by Anglo American after its iron ore division Kumba announced it would resume dividend payments. Kumba announced a R15.97 per share interim cash dividend, in accordance with the board’s policy of returning excess cash to shareholders, it said. At 9.38am Kumba was up 8.64% to R187.95 and Anglo American had added 5.31% to R195.50. Anglo American’s rise supported global miners, with BHP climbing 2.52% to R223.23. Platinum shares rebounded but gold stocks retreated despite a weaker dollar. Retailers, banks and financials were also higher as the rand continued to trade below R13 to the dollar. However, analysts said the fact that it had not firmed further could point to some weakness over the short term.
