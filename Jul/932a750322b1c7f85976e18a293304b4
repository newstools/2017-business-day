The DA is to lay charges of money laundering and corruption against the South African component of global software giant, SAP, and Gupta-affiliated company CAD House, following allegations that kickbacks changed hands between the two companies in exchange for a R100m Transnet contract. SAP has denied the allegations which emerged from leaked Gupta-linked e-mails. According to media reports, SAP Africa promised to pay a 10% "commission" to CAD House, which is majority owned by the Gupta family’s Sahara Systems, if it secured contracts with Transnet. SAP’s shares are listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and also trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) via American depositary receipts. CAD House, a 3-D printing company, is owned by President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane, and businesses linked to Sahara. DA spokesperson on public enterprises Natasha Mazzone said the consultancy with CAD House was "rather irregular considering that SAP is an international software giant which had existing contracts with Transnet. Furthermore, CAD House is a small company which specialises in selling 3-D printers and which allegedly had no previous relationships with SAP or expertise in this field. "The DA has reason to believe that SAP SA procured the services of CAD House purely because they wanted access to its owners, Duduzane Zuma and the Guptas’, connections within Transnet with a view to securing a lucrative contract." Mazzone said it was not enough that SAP had suspended a number of its key executives in SA. "It is simply not enough that the implicated SAP SA executives are scapegoated. These dealings must have gone higher up in SAP and all those involved should be held accountable. This is not the first time SAP has been caught with its hands in the cookie jar. The firm has previously been found guilty of bribery in numerous countries and the revelations that SAP SA had ignored a number of red flags about CAD House is even further cause for concern," Mazzone said.
