The rand, which strengthened from R13.23/$ to R12.99/$ on Friday following a court victory against Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane’s controversial Mining Charter, was trading at R13.05/$ at 7am on Monday morning. The setback for the Mining Charter lifted Anglo American 2.38% to R192.36 and Sasol 1.25% to R378.75 on Friday, helping the JSE’s all share index clock up its fifth consecutive day of gains, taking its run for the week to 3.3%. Whether the JSE is set for another good week was unclear from the mixed signals received from stock exchanges trading ahead of it on Monday morning. China’s second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth accelerated to 1.7% quarter on quarter, accelerating from 1.3% in the first quarter, meeting economists’ consensus. Compared with a year earlier, GDP grew 6.9%, up from 6.8% in the first quarter. But mainland Chinese investors appeared disappointed that economic growth failed to beat forecasts, and sent the Shenzhen composite index down 2.24% and the Shanghai composite index down 0.11%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, however, gained 0.58%. The Tokyo stock exchange was closed on Monday for a public holiday, and Sydney’s S&P/ASX 200 index was fractionally lower.
