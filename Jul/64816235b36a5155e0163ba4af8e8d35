Singapore — Oil prices held steady on Thursday following solid gains the previous day when falling US fuel inventories lifted the market. However, Brent crude oil prices remain below the key $50 a barrel mark on concern about high supply from producer club Opec despite a pledge to cut output in a bid to tighten the market. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $49.67 a barrel at 1.32am GMT, just 3c below their last settlement. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $47.08 a barrel, 4c below their last close. Prices jumped nearly 2% in the previous session on news of falling fuel stocks in the US. US crude inventories fell by 4.7-million barrels in the week to July 14 to 490.6-million barrels. That compared with analyst expectations for a decrease of 3.2-million barrels. "Over the past 15 weeks, US oil inventories have fallen … 13 times, and in most cases, the falls were more pronounced than expected," said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at futures brokerage Forex.com. "Yet, US crude oil inventories still remain near the upper half of the average for this time of the year," he added. Ongoing high inventories as well as high output from Opec were preventing prices from rising much further, traders said. Opec, together with some nonmembers like Russia, has pledged to cut production by 1.8-million barrels a day between January this year and March 2018. However, a lack in compliance by some countries and exemptions for Opec members Nigeria and Libya have undermined that effort, keeping supply high and preventing prices from rising by much. Libya said on Wednesday it was aiming to produce 1.25-million barrels a day by the end of the year and 1.5-million barrels a day by the end of 2018. Libya’s national production has recently stood at just more than 1-million barrels a day, up from lows of around 250,000 barrels a day a year ago. Reuters
