An investigation commissioned by Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba following allegations of fraud and corruption at City Power has resulted in calls for "corrective action" to be taken against 14 officials. The forensic report compiled by audit firm SizweNtsalubaGobodo detailed breaches of procurement and contractual obligations and the contravention of the Municipal Finance Management Act. It also revealed instances of gross financial mismanagement arising from discretionary allowances given to six officials. Sicelo Xulu, the former MD of City Power, is one of the officials against whom "corrective action" should be taken, according to the report, as well as Quentin Green, the chief financial officer at the entity. The report did not say what the corrective action should be. The power utility had not returned calls late on Thursday. . Xulu was fired by the City Power board after the release of the report. He said he had not yet seen the report that led to him being fired. It is also understood that he would be most likely to challenge the findings. The report proposes "corrective action" against Xulu for, among other things, issuing discretionary allowances worth R221,745.72 without a budget for it and for an "irregular instruction" to issue the allowance to the six officials. Corrective action was recommended against Green, Louis Pieterse, GM for the learning academy and Peter Alan, acting GM for facilities, for failing to establish internal controls and managing, safeguarding and maintaining City Power assets stored in the Fleet Africa Warehouse. Mashabaâ€™s spokesman, Tony Taverna-Turisan, said the group forensic investigation services run by former Gauteng Hawks boss Shadrack Sibiya was compiling a report on what action the city should take. This could include criminal charges. "The mayor will ensure action is taken against every official implicated in this report."
