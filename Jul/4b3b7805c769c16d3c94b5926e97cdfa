The South African Social Security Authority (Sassa) is in the throes of a fresh crisis with revelations that its newly appointed acting CEO, Pearl Bhengu, is in business with the 21-year-old daughter of her boss, Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini. The Mail & Guardian is reporting that a company records search has revealed that Dlamini’s daughter, Skhumbuzo Mazibuko, and Bhengu are both directors of Umnotho Wabafazi Biz. The company was registered in July 2015 when Mazibuko was just 19 years old. A third director is also listed. The Mail & Guardian found the business to be active, yet in response to questions, social development spokesperson Lumka Oliphant said it never got off the ground. In any case, this seems to indicate the minister’s closeness with Bhengu who replaces Thokozani Magwaza. Oliphant said the company was started by a group of women for the sole purpose of buying shares, with a view of entering the maritime industry. She said the deal never materialised as it hinged on the group being accepted as part of a consortium, which did not happen. According to Oliphant, Bhengu had disclosed her directorship in Umnotho Wabafazi Biz, as required by law. However, Oliphant did not respond to a question about the potential conflict of interest such an association may pose. Dlamini announced on Monday that an "agreement" had been reached with Magwaza to terminate his contract — which insiders said was due to the irretrievable breakdown in their relationship. However, Magwaza is still due to testify against Dlamini in a public inquiry about her role in the Sassa social grants payments debacle.
