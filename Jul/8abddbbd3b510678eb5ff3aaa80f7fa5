The rand was relatively steady on Friday morning, maintaining a stronger bias near the end of a week that was dominated by global factors. The release of US inflation data later in the day will take centre stage, after US Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen signalled earlier in the week that the US central bank was not in a rush to raise interest rates while inflation was still below its 2% target. US inflation is likely to have moderated to an annual rate of 1.8% in June, according to Trading Economics, from 1.9% in May. "The CPI [consumer price index] figure is set to be the last piece of the puzzle for the short-term direction in the US after much has been said this week about the monetary tightening expectations and possible interest rate hike," TreasuryOne dealer Gerard van der Westhuizen said in a note The Fed’s less-hawkish stance on rates comes amid mounting pressure on the South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee to lower rates to help relieve pressure on the local economy. The committee meets next week to decide on rates. But Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago has previously cited the volatility in the rand exchange rate as the key risk to inflation. As one of the most liquid emerging-market currencies, the rand remains volatile. This week alone, it swung between R13.15/$ and R13.63/$. At 9.2am, the rand was at R13.1898 to the dollar from Thursday’s R13.2084, at R15.0587 to the euro from R15.0553 and at R17.0954 to the pound from R17.0884. The euro was at $1.1417 from $1.1398.
