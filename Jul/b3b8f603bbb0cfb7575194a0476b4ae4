The Reserve Bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its July 20 meeting, according to a Reuters poll released on Monday, but economists expect a dovish statement as the Bank gets closer to its easing cycle. Twenty-four of 27 economists said the Reserve Bank will hold rates at 7% on Thursday. Two predicted a 25-basis-point cut and one expects the repo rate to be cut by 50 basis points. Economic growth in SA will be weaker this year after the country slipped into recession in the first quarter, and with inflation easing an interest rate cut is expected in the first quarter of next year. "While our consumer price index view indicates that the Bank has room to ease rates from as early as next week, it will first look to change its inflation rates narrative before pulling the trigger," Jeffrey Schultz, an economist at BNP Paribas, said last week. Schultz said at least two members of the monetary policy committee could vote in favour of a 25-basis-point cut next Thursday. At its May meeting, only one of the six committee members voted for a cut. "This should send a signal that September is a ‘live’ meeting," he said. At 5.4% in May, inflation has been slowing after a drought last year and will probably average 5.4% this year and 5.3% next year. The rand is expected to end this year near R13.60/$. It is currently at R12.96 with slower rate increases now expected in the US. Wall Street’s top banks brought forward expectations for when the Federal Reserve will begin reducing its $4.5-trillion bond portfolio to as early as September. They see balance sheet reduction as more of a priority than another rate rise. SA’s economy is expected to expand 0.7% in 2017 and 1.2% the following year, after contracting 0.7% in the first quarter. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba laid out a 14-point programme on Thursday to lift the economy out of recession. It includes the sale of noncore assets and partial privatisation of state-owned companies. Reuters
