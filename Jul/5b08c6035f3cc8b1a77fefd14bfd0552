The 24-hour guard at Public Works Minister Nathi Nhleko’s Empangeni house has been removed with immediate effect. The house — where his son, a domestic worker and a groundsman reside — was guarded by eight public order policing officers and an Nyala armoured vehicle. On Sunday the Sunday Times reported that the South African Police Union (Sapu) had written to provincial police management in June to complain about members of the Empangeni public order police cluster being stationed outside Nhleko’s house. Nhleko was police minister before being moved to the Department of Public Works in President Jacob Zuma’s recent Cabinet reshuffle. Opposition parties have criticised what they call an abuse of police resources by government officials. The DA’s leader in KwaZulu-Natal, Zwakele Mncwango, said communities were often told that lack of resources, vehicles and personnel were behind the failure to combat escalating crime. Sapu’s provincial secretary, Nurse Mdletshe, said they had been told the armoured vehicle and the public order police officers were removed from the minister’s home on Monday. She said the union still wanted an investigation, though. "We have made inquiries into the South African Police Service’s VIP protection unit and they have referred the matter to the Public Order Policing Unit," she said. "We are determined to find out who ordered that this [protection service] should be provided. "It is clear that politicians are abusing the system. They are not afraid to just talk to someone in police management to give authority for our members to act on instruction. It seems like this arrangement was made through a gentlemen’s agreement," Mdletshe said. Lesiba Kgwele, Nhleko’s spokesperson, told journalists that the minister could not comment on this matter because it was in the hands of the Department of Police, which does not fall under his control. "The police and the Ministry of Police would be more appropriate to comment on that matter," he said.
