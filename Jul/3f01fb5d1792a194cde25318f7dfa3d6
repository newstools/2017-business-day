The South African bond market steadied on Wednesday morning, pausing for breath after a strong run over the past few days. The yield on the benchmark R186 bond, which broadly reflects the cost of government borrowing, hovered around 8.645% in early trade, from 8.620% at its settlement on Tuesday. Local bonds have benefited from the recent pick-up in global risk appetite, which also boosted the fortunes of the rand. The release of local inflation figures later in the day may nudge local bonds out of their current trading range. Markets expect headline inflation to have moderated to an annual rate of 5.2% in June, from 5.4% in May. The inflation figures are likely to help to shape the approach of the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee, which is due to decide on interest rates on Thursday. "With consensus at 5.2%, from last month’s 5.4%, we expect some strength [in bonds] after the release as we are calling for a 5.1% number. The reaction will be muted to some degree, though as we await Thursday’s [monetary policy committee] announcement," said Rand Merchant Bank analyst Deon Kohlmeyer US treasury bonds were firmer in early trade, with the yield on the 10-year note dipping to 2.2725%, from 2.3153% on Tuesday.
