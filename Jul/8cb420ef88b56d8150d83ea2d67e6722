Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter named on Tuesday a 23-man squad to compete over two legs against Botswana in the qualifiers of the African Nations Championship. Bafana will play the first leg in Francistown on Saturday and Baxter included Premier Soccer League experience in the form of Riyaad Noriden of Orlando Pirates‚ Mario Booysen of Mamelodi Sundowns‚ Cole Alexander of SuperSport United and the unattached Lehlohonolo Masalesa. There could be a snag over Masalesa’s selection as only locally based players are eligible to play in the competition. Until recently, he was contracted to Greek side Larissa, but has since become a free agent. African confederation Caf is yet to make a final decision on his eligibility. A number of Amajita players were included in the squad after a first training session on Tuesday.
