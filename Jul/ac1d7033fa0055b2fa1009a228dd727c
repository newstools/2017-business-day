Stock exchanges trading ahead of the JSE’s opening on Friday morning were slightly down, possibly because of Microsoft’s share price falling 0.3% in after-hours trade on Nasdaq. Microsoft’s share price initially jumped 4% after it released its fourth-quarter results that beat expectations, but then fell after chief financial officer Amy Hood said she expected revenue to decline in the first quarter of its 2018 financial year. Hood said revenue for the quarter under way was expected to be in a range of $23.6bn-$24.3bn, lower than the $24.7bn it reported for the June quarter. Taiwan’s TSEC index was down 0.46%, Shanghai’s composite index was down 0.2% and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.56%. The JSE’s retailers cheered the Reserve Bank’s surprise decision to cut interest rates on Thursday. Clothing retailer Truworths rose 4.06% to R78.50, Walmart’s South African subsidiary Massmart rose 3.81% to R112.63 and Mr Price rose 3.29% to R175.60. The 2.57% rally in the JSE’s general retailers index helped the all share index gain 0.36% on Thursday. Four of the six members of the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee voted to cut the repo rate to 6.75% from 7%. By convention, South African banks add 3.5 percentage points to the central bank’s repo rate to set the "prime rate" — their benchmark used to set interest rates on home, car and other loans. The Reserve Bank’s 25 basis point cut means the prime rate will drop from 10.5% to 10.25%, meaning consumers paying the prime rate will see a 2.38% reduction in their monthly interest bill. The good news in the Reserve Bank’s reasons for cutting its repo rate from 7% to 6.75% was that it expects inflation to slow to 4.6% by the first quarter of 2018. The bad news was its forecast for SA’s economic growth for 2017 was halved to 0.5%. "With the [monetary policy committee’s] break with its earlier logic of maintaining caution given the fraught domestic policy and political environment further cuts are now likely in 2017 and in early 2018. We now think that the [committee] will cut the repo rate by 25 basis points in September, January and March and then leave rates flat into 2018," Nedbank said in an economic note e-mailed on Thursday. Stanlib chief economist Kevin Lings also forecast a further 25 basis point cut within the next six to nine months.
