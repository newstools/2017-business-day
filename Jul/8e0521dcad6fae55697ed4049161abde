The rand was marginally weaker against global major currencies ahead of the release of consumer inflation data later in the morning. The expectation is that the consumer price index (CPI) slowed to 5.2% in June from 5.4% in May. Nedbank analysts said that "food and transport were likely to remain key disinflationary drivers of local inflation over the medium term". While short-term inflation risks were expected to be muted, "concerns remained about the medium-term inflation outlook as well as the negative impact that a whipsawing currency can have on inflation expectations", said Bidvest analysts. Statistics SA will release retail sales for May later in the day. Globally, markets are expected to trade in narrow ranges ahead of policy statements from the European and Japanese central banks, both due on Thursday. At 9am the rand was at R12.9568 to the dollar from Tuesdayâ€™s R12.9020, at R14.9377 to the euro from R14.9061 and at R16.8897 to the pound from R16.8216. The euro was at $1.1529 from $1.1553.
