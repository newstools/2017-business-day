The rand was slightly firmer on Wednesday morning with markets focussed on Federal Reserve chairperson Janet Yellen’s speech before congress on Wednesday and Thursday. Yellen is expected to address congress on her views on the state of the economy, guide the markets on the Fed’s $4.5-trillion balance sheet unwinding and on any further interest-rate increases this year. Rand Merchant Bank analyst Neville Mandimika said afternoon trade would be guided by global monetary policy which could see risk assets affected. Mandimika said that interest-rate increases could be seen as market negative, "as markets had been sceptical about the Fed’s willingness to increase interest rates in an inflationary environment." The Dow Jones Newswires reported that the Fed governor Lael Brainard said on Tuesday it would soon be the right time for the Fed to begin shrinking its balance sheet portfolio but expressed concerns that inflation needed to move closer to its 2% target in the coming months. At 9.02am, the rand was at R13.5183 to the dollar from Tuesday’s R13.5588, at R15.4872 to the euro from R15.5473 and at R17.3341 to the pound from R17.4235. The euro was at $1.1456 from $1.1466.
