Briancon —Tour de France leader Chris Froome survived a thrilling Col d’Izoard climb on Thursday, holding on to his yellow jersey as Frenchman Romain Bardet’s hopes of mounting a decisive attack fizzled out. With fellow Frenchman Warren Barguil producing a stunning burst on the brutal 14km climb to the summit to claim victory on stage 18, all eyes were on what was going on back down the road. Team Sky’s Froome, who began the final big day of climbing in the Alps with a 27sec lead over Bardet and Rigoberto Uran, was pressurised on the unrelenting slopes as Bardet’s AG2R La Mondiale team tried to loosen his grip. But Froome crossed the line just behind Bardet, who he now leads by 23sec, with Uran — now 29sec behind — also in close support. Now only an extraordinary meltdown or a crash seem likely to stop the Briton taking a fourth Tour title. Barguil sealed the polka dot climber’s jersey with a brilliant ride up the iconic Izoard climb. Colombia’s Darwin Atapuma was second. Best placed of the South Africans in the field is Louis Meintjes who is eighth overall, 6min 52sec behind Froome. Friday’s stage is a relatively straightforward 222km ride south before Saturday’s time trial, where Froome is likely to extend his lead for the yellow jersey. Reuters
