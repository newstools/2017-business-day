The rand strengthened on Tuesday morning, stretching its winning run to the dollar to five consecutive sessions The local currency firmed through R12.90/$, a sharp turnaround from the R13.63/$ it was at last week, mirroring a broadly positive sentiment towards emerging markets. To this end, SA attracted just more than R3bn in bond inflows over the past week. Foreigners were also net buyers of local shares over the same period. The suspension of the implementation of the controversial third version of the Mining Charter had also boosted sentiment, analysts said. The Chamber of Mines, which represents mining companies in the country, is seeking a court challenge to set aside the stipulations of the charter, which seeks to increase black ownership from the current 26% to 30%. The weaker dollar continues to be main theme on global markets, following disappointing US inflation and retail sales data last week, which cast doubt on the strength of the US economy. The weaker greenback played out favourably for commodity prices, including platinum, which hovered around $923.22/oz, bouncing off its recent lows of $889.39/oz. Investors will be close attention to the outcome of the Reserve Bankâ€™s monetary policy committee later in the week for clues on the future path of interest rates. Markets expect the committee to keep repurchase rate on hold at 7% on Thursday. At 8.57am, the rand was at R12.8980 to the dollar from R12.9471, at R14.8684 to the euro from R14.8638 and at R16.8974 to the pound from R16.9035. The euro was at $1.1528 from $1.1478.
