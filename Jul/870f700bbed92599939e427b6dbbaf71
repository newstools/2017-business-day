The truant Ajax Cape Town defender Rivaldo Coetzee has apologised to the club after going AWOL for more than three weeks and has been relegated to the reserve team. Coetzee said in a video on the club’s Twitter account on Tuesday that he had held a meeting with his employers before training with the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) team. "I requested a meeting with the Ajax CT bosses to discuss my future with the club‚" Coetzee said. He apologised "to the club‚ coaches and my teammates for the way I behaved over the past three weeks". He had apologised to coach Stanley Menzo "and we will decide what the future holds". He had returned to training with the MDC team on Tuesday, he said. Coetzee did not report for pre season training as he wanted to leave the club or land a better deal after being named Player of the Year and Players’ Player of the Year in the 2016-17 season. The 20-year-old Bafana international attracted interest from home and abroad‚ but clubs were put off by the R13m price tag Ajax reportedly placed on him. TimesLIVE
