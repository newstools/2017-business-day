Former Springbok wing James Small believes Rohan Janse van Rensburg should get a starting berth for the Lions when they clash with the Sharks in their Super Rugby eliminator at Ellis Park on Saturday. Having recovered from a knee injury sustained in April‚ Janse van Rensburg returned to Super Rugby action from the bench last weekend. Harold Vorster has worn the No12 jersey with some distinction in his absence. It has left the coaches with a slight selection conundrum ahead of their team announcement on Thursday. Small‚ who represented the Lions and Sharks in the 1990s‚ said Janse van Rensburg should get the nod. "If he’s fit‚ you can’t not have Rohan Janse van Rensburg‚" said Small about the barrel-chested inside centre who charged his way into the Springbok team in 2016. "In fact‚ the Lions have so many players who have put their hand up." Small holds the popular view that the Lions will have too much firepower for the Sharks. "They have a back three in [Andries] Coetzee‚ [Ruan] Combrinck and [Courtnall] Skosan who are Springboks and are playing with confidence. "It’s all about the finishers and the Lions have better finishers. They have so many of these guys who have the X-factor. I’m a big fan of the Sharks‚ but I don’t know if the Sharks have enough to beat the Lions. "The Sharks simply don’t have enough on the front foot. Their processes and systems‚ particularly on defence are strong‚ but I’m not sure if they have the individuals." Small has a point when you juxtapose the Lions’ try-scoring potency with the Sharks’ limitations in attack. They have scored 38 tries compared with the Lions’ 81. The Lions are the second-highest try scorers while the Sharks’ Curwin Bosch has banged over the most penalties this season.
