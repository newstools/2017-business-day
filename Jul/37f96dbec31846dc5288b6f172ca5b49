Bengaluru — Gold held steady on Friday near a three-week high and was on track for a second consecutive weekly gain, underpinned by a weaker dollar and US political uncertainty. Heightened political concern surrounding investigations into President Donald Trump’s campaign ties with Russia was the key driver supporting gold prices, said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda in Singapore. The euro also held near two-year highs against the dollar on Friday after the head of the European Central Bank (ECB) said tapering of its stimulus would be on the table this northern autumn. A weaker dollar makes US dollar denominated gold more attractive for buyers using other currencies. Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,245.01/oz at 4.01am GMT after touching a three-week high of $1,247.48/oz in the previous session. It is up about 1.4% for the week so far. US gold futures for August delivery fell 0.1% to $1,244.70/oz. "What we’re seeing right now is the overhang from political risks in the US," Innes said. The Republican Party’s repeated failures to overhaul the healthcare system and multiple congressional and federal investigations into Trump’s campaign’s ties to Russia have cast a shadow over his first six months in office. The ECB left its ultra easy monetary policy unchanged on Thursday and did not even discuss clawing back stimulus, suggesting it may delay an inevitable decision on tapering bond buys until the latest possible moment. Spot gold could test a resistance at $1,250/oz, a break above which could lead to a further gain to $1,261, said Reuters technical analyst, Wang Tao. "The gold-silver ratio closed slightly lower today, at 76.05," said analysts at ScotiaMocatta, adding that "resistance is at 77.92, the recent high and support is at 74.82". Among other precious metals, silver fell 0.1% to $16.28/oz after touching $16.42 in the previous session, the highest since July 3. Platinum fell 0.4% to $922.49/oz but was up about 1% for the week. Palladium rose 0.4% to $845.65/oz but was down around 1.4% for the week. Reuters
