The JSE started the week firmer on Monday with broad-based gains as upbeat trade in Hong Kong supported Naspers. Chinese company Tencent, of which Naspers owns 33.2%, was sharply up on the Hang Seng after the Chinese authorities announced a clampdown on WhatsApp’s activities in the country, thereby boosting Tencent’s messaging app WeChat. Tencent effectively operates in a closed market. At 9.36am Naspers was up 1.35% to R2,844. The all share added 0.58% to 54,474.80 points and the blue-chip top 40 rose 0.68%. Banks and retailers were early market favourites after the rand firmed to R12.8802 in morning trade before weakening marginally. Food and drug retailers rose 0.84%, general retailers 0.82%, banks 0.81%, industrials 0.77% and financials 0.54%. The platinum index softened 0.16% on a weaker performance from Impala Platinum, which fell 1.41% to R36.34, while Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) climbed 0.19% to R312.12. Amplats announced after the opening that interim headline earnings per share (HEPS) to end-June fell to 285c from 629c. Operating profit dropped 78% to R684m from R3bn. Market focus was on Wednesday’s US Federal Reserve meeting, with the Federal open market committee (FOMC) set to keep rates on hold. However, the Fed is expected to provide more information on the planned sell-off of its inflated balance sheet. The market is at present only expecting one further rate increase in the US in 2017. A more hawkish message from the Fed may point to a firmer dollar after the greenback lost out last week on the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) message that it would commence with talks on shrinking its own balance sheet in September. Barclays Research analysts said evidence that the global recovery was gaining further momentum continued to show up in the data, while inflationary pressures remained absent. "This complicated the job of central banks at a time when the gradual exit from exceptional monetary support was on the agenda," Barclays said. As expected, neither the Bank of Japan (BoJ) nor the ECB made any change to their monetary policy stance last week, with both pointing to the lack of inflationary pressures. Barclays expects the Fed to announce further detail on its balance sheet normalisation only at the September meeting. After losing 3.73% on Monday, ArcelorMittal was up 0.61% to R4.94. It warned last week its headline loss per share for the six months to end-June would be up to three times higher than that of the previous comparable period. Truworths rose 1.05% to R78.32, after reporting earlier that it expected its diluted HEPS for the year ended July 2 to decrease by up to 3%. Woolworths recovered 1.28% to R63.30. Among banks, Nedbank rose 1.17% to R215.76 and Barclays Africa 0.88% to R147.99. New property giant on the block Nepi Rockcastle was down 0.15% to R176.73. Taste Holdings rebounded 7.41% to R1.45.
