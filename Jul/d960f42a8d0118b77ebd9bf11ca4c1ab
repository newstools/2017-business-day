The rand was weaker against global currencies on Thursday morning as markets awaited decisions from central banks. The local market is waiting for the Reserve Bank’s decision on interest rates in the afternoon. The Bank is expected to keep the repo rate on hold at 7%, despite a favourable inflation trend. On Wednesday, Statistics SA reported that annual consumer inflation for June had slowed to 5.1%‚ from 5.4% in May. NKC Research analyst Elize Kruger said the favourable inflation trend, resilience of the rand and "the dismal state of the economy" were building a case for some monetary policy easing in the second half of 2017. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s earlier suggestion, which was later retracted, to have the Bank’s mandate reviewed, "could, in essence, imply that inflation targeting as a monetary policy framework could be dropped and the Bank would lose its independence to some extent". "That will probably act as a deterrent to monetary policy loosening in the short term," said Kruger. Investors are also waiting for the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) announcement later in the day. Dow Jones Newswires reported that the focus would be on fresh guidance from the ECB towards tighter monetary policy. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) announced earlier that it had kept its monetary policy steady. At 9.01am the rand was at R12.9521 to the dollar from Wednesday’s R12.9174‚ at R14.9244 to the euro from R14.8747 and at R16.8662 to the pound from R16.8229. The euro was at $1.1523 from $1.1515.
