The JSE all share opened firmer in thin trade on Wednesday as higher commodity prices lifted platinum and gold shares with resources stocks on the back foot due to the firmer rand. Banks and general retailers benefited from a marginally firmer rand, which was at R13.47/$ from R13.55/$. Volumes traded did not exceed R500m after the opening, promising another low-volume trading day that has become the norm over the past two months. Commodity stocks trended higher after sharp overnight weakness in the dollar following dovish comments from US Federal Reserve officials ahead of chairwoman Janet Yellenâ€™s address to Congress later in the day. A rebound in oil prices also helped commodities, with Brent crude 0.39% up at $48.30 a barrel in early morning trade. The platinum price added 0.42% to $905.43/oz and gold rose 0.13% to $1.218.93/oz. The Dow closed flat on Tuesday. Asian markets were mixed, with the Nikkei 225 down 0.48% and the Hang Seng up 0.66%. BlackRock Asset Management analysts said the world was in a synchronised and sustained economic expansion that was slower than previous cycles. "Structurally lower growth and higher interest rates meant that comparing valuation metrics to past levels might not be a good guide to the future," BlackRock said. At 9.40am the all share was 0.41% higher at 52,593.70 points and the blue-chip top 40 added 0.44%. The gold index gained 1.21%, banks 1.09%, property 0.57% and general retailers 0.55%.
