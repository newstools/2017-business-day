There was recognition at the ANC policy conference of the importance of the private sector in driving economic growth, but more has to be done to deal with key concerns, says Business Unity SA CEO Tanya Cohen. Organised business remains concerned about policy certainty and stable operating conditions that will stimulate confidence, she said. Business was in agreement that its relationship with the government remained strained and there was a long way to go before it could be repaired. "Government, across all areas, can enhance efforts to partner with business in this regard," said Cohen. Many arms of government had a robust and healthy relationship with business, but this was "not synergised across all areas of government", she said. Business Leadership SA CEO Bonang Mohale said the organisation was emboldened by the ANC’s commitment to the Reserve Bank’s independence, but the trust deficit was unlikely to be resolved unless there was an inquiry into state capture. Black Business Council general secretary George Sebulela said: "I would not say that the relationship is strained, but there’s a huge expectation from business for the government to fast-track implementation."
