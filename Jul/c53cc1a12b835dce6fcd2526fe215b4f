The JSE opened firmer on Friday, with banks supported by a firmer rand, and platinum and gold shares gaining. Resources were softer, though, despite commodity prices benefiting from a weaker dollar, as the euro’s rally persisted. The rand, which was at R12.97/$ from R13.03, was supported by continued inflows into bonds on the rate cut and positive inflation outlook. Although European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi did not give a timetable on Thursday for when the bank will tighten monetary policy and pull back its asset-buying programme, the euro has surged recently on hawkish comments from him about the state of the economy. The ECB left interest rates unchanged on Thursday. The JSE’s banks and retailers rose in risk-on trade, with the Reserve Bank’s unexpected rate cut on Thursday providing further support. General retailers led the upside on Thursday, rising 2.57% on the day. Commodity prices were marginally up on the weaker dollar. Gold rose 0.23% to $1,247.35 an ounce. On Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.13% lower at 21,611.78.

At 9.44am the all share was up 0.35% to 54,474.70 and the blue-chip top 40 gained 0.38%. The gold index rose 1.15%, the platinum index was up 0.64%, industrials rose 0.53%, property added 0.34% and general retailers were 0.32% stronger. Resources softened 0.18%.
