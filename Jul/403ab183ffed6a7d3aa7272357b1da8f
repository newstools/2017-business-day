The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act has an adverse effect on poor communities, says former president Kgalema Motlanthe. Motlanthe chairs a panel of 17 people mandated by Parliament to probe recent legislation and how these laws have affected South Africans, especially with regard to poverty, inequality and job creation‚ the equitable redistribution of wealth‚ land reform and restitution and nation building and social cohesion. Motlanthe said at a public interest law meeting at the University of the Western Cape on Tuesday that the panel would release its report at the end of August. Three working groups which had travelled across the country meeting communities‚ and who received more than 1‚000 written submissions, had exposed many issues, he said. The land issue came up in almost every meeting. "Redistribution has all but ground to a halt because of too many incoherent policies," he said. Asked about "bad legislation" such as the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act‚ Motlanthe said they found that it took about eight years to get a greenfields mining project to the operational stage. "Only people with deep pockets can go through that process‚" he said. Legislation was also a "hell of a disadvantage" for communities where mining was being done as traditional leaders were allowed to sign off on projects "under the pretence of representing everyone". Mining companies gave these leaders "an office or a 4x4 vehicle and they sign off". The panel would suggest "remedies" for this, he said. "If you have a captured state‚ the matter is exacerbated because then they don’t even care about going through the processes properly." As a result‚ mining companies with access to capital are "at the head of the queue" and empowerment partners, not communities, benefit from the deals.
