Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba says that apart from helping to establish the Postbank, the Treasury is not planning to establish another state bank. The proposal that the government create a state bank emerged from the ANC policy conference in June, but this will have to be ratified at the party’s December conference for it to become official policy. Gigaba’s spokesman Mayihlome Tshwete confirmed that the only “state bank” that the Treasury was involved in creating was Postbank, which needs to get a licence from the Registrar of Banks to operate as a fully fledged bank. The Treasury was reviewing and could possibly consolidate some of the development finance institutions, Gigaba said on Monday in reply to a parliamentary question. Gigaba noted that a number of state banks were already operating, including the Land Bank, Development Bank of Southern Africa, Postbank and many other development finance institutions. “Whilst there is an initiative to review and possibly consolidate some of the development finance institutions, there is no intention to consolidate the different banks into one state bank, as they serve different markets,” the minister said. “The Department of Human Settlements is … merging the three development finance institutions under its watch … to create one human settlements development finance institution. “There is also the process of merging the National Empowerment Fund into the Industrial Development Corporation.” Ithala Bank is a legacy institution owned by KwaZulu-Natal but the Constitution prohibits other provinces from establishing new state banks. Gigaba noted that the Treasury had been working with the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services to establish the Postbank division of the South African Post Office as a standalone state bank with its own governance structures. Postbank was granted authorisation to establish a bank by the Registrar of Banks in July 2016.
