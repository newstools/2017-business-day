Singapore — Oil prices rose more than 1.5% on Wednesday, extending gains from the previous day as the US government cut its crude production outlook for next year and as fuel inventories plunged. Brent crude futures were up 76c, or 1.6%, at $48.28 a barrel by 4.29am GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $45.82 a barrel, up 78c, or 1.7%. Both settled about 1.4% higher on Tuesday. "The oil price … climbed sharply overnight as the Energy Information Agency cut its forecast for US production in 2018 and API data showed another large inventory drawdown," said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. US crude oil inventories fell by 8.1-million barrels in the week to July 7 to 495.6-million, according to the American Petroleum Institute (API), in an indictor that a long-standing fuel supply overhang is starting to draw down. "Brent and WTI spot staged an impressive … rally … as the API reported a massive 8.1-million barrel drawdown in inventories," said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. "All eyes will now turn to the official US crude inventories number this evening," he added. Also, the US Energy Information Administration said late on Tuesday that it expected 2018 crude oil output to rise to 9.9-million barrels a day from 9.3-million barrels a day this year, a 570,000 barrels a day increase. This was down from last month’s forecast 680,000 barrels a day year-on-year increase. Despite the slight downward revision, US production is still set to break the 9.61-million barrels a day record from June 2015. At the same time, output from the oil cartel Opec remains high despite a pledge led by the producer group to cut supplies between January of this year and March 2018 in to tighten the market and prop up prices.
