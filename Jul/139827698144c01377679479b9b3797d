The DA has called on Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi to urgently intervene in what it says is a "looming national pathology strike". DA health spokesperson Patricia Kopane said in a statement on Tuesday that the pending strike followed an admission by the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) that it would not be able to meet the 7.3% salary increase demanded by pathology professionals and their trade unions. The NHLS was only able to offer 3%. "It is crucial that arrangements are made with private laboratories in advance, as a strike at the NHLS will be devastating for patients in need of urgent tests for HIV/AIDS, malaria, cancer and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis," Kopane said. She added that the strike could have "devastating consequences", as the NHLS was responsible for more than 80% of the countryâ€™s pathology diagnostic services. Kopane said Motsoaledi should provide a detailed plan of action to deal with the consequences of the strike. A strike by about 180 forensic assistants in Gauteng ended when the provincial health department promised to reverse their remuneration scales to their pre-2010 levels. The forensic assistants had embarked on industrial action, claiming they were underpaid and doing work they were not qualified for.
