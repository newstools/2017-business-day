Legendary trainer Mike de Kock can complete a hat-trick of wins in the eLan Gold Cup when Kinaan does duty for his stable in the 3,200m marathon at Greyville on Sunday. De Kock won with ill-fated Wild One in 2015 and took the trophy again with Enaad 12 months ago. Stablemate Kinaan ran third in that race and is favourite to go two places better this time. In a rather guarded comment on their website, De Kock’s son Mathew comments that Kinaan leaves for Durban on Friday. "He’s well weighted and nicely drawn — he is a horse with a chance." Well, thanks for that Mat, but this column’s advice is for punters to have a serious punt on Callan Murray’s mount. He is set to carry 0.5kg less than a year ago and this could be a decisive factor over the final 200m. Kinaan’s recent third in the Gold Vase was the perfect trial for the Gold Cup, although the connections of both Hermoso Mundo and Captain Splendid will fancy their chances of taking the R781,250 first prize. Hermoso Mundo, awarded the Gold Vase over Captain Splendid after an objection, has received a six-point penalty for that success, so trainer Justin Snaith will fancy the chances of his four-year-old getting his revenge. Hermoso Mundo could turn in another gutsy effort.
