Belgrade — Twelve-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic will miss the rest of the tennis season to recover from an elbow injury, the Serbian said on Wednesday. The 30-year-old posted a video statement on Facebook in which he said he had decided to rest the injury which caused him to retire during his recent Wimbledon quarterfinal against Czech Tomas Berdych. "I’ve made a decision to not play any competitions or tournaments for the rest of the 2017 season," Djokovic, down at No4 in the world rankings for the first time since 2009, said. "It’s a decision that had to be made. "I have been dragging this injury for the past 18 months and it has escalated in the last month or two," he said. "I had to make a radical decision. It was a difficult one but I had no choice and will now have time to heal my body. "Surgery is not necessary, all the surgeons I have spoken to have not recommended that course of action." Djokovic has endured a dreadful 12 months on the court, losing all the Grand Slam titles he held simultaneously after winning the 2016 French Open, as well as the No1 ranking. Reuters
