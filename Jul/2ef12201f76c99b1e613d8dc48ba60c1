Mediclinic International announced on Tuesday that CE Danie Meintjes would retire. Meintjes has been at the helm of the private hospital group since 2010, but his history with the company stretches back to 1985, when he first started as a hospital manager at Mediclinic Sandton. He also oversaw Mediclinicâ€™s international expansion, including the acquisition of Middle East hospital group Al Noor in 2015. The company said a nomination committee would start the process of replacing Meintjes, who is scheduled to leave in July 2018. The share was up 1.38% at R124.72 in mid-morning trade on the JSE, giving Mediclinic a market value of R92.3bn.
