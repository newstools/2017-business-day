The racist MiWay e-mail is fake and was sent by a policyholder, who has been identified, a report by digital forensic lab Cyanre found. "We can confirm, after a detailed investigation, that an e-mail sent from a MiWay employee was manipulated by an external source. The image circulating on social media is a fabrication," Cyanre MD Danny Myburgh said. The e-mail, which was widely circulated on social media and supposedly sent by a MiWay claims assessor, described a manager’s meeting in which it was agreed that 90% of claims made by black people would be rejected from August 1. The e-mail elicited widespread vitriol on social media, even after MiWay said that no such meeting had taken place and an internal investigation had revealed the e-mail was fake. Twitter users said they had cancelled their MiWay policies and encouraged others to do the same. MiWay had decided to provide the policyholder with the opportunity to respond before publishing Cyanre’s report, said CEO René Otto. "Once we have received feedback, we will be in a position to elaborate on the way forward." MiWay had rejected the policyholder’s insurance claim because policy conditions were not adhered to. The Ombudsman for Short-term Insurance had upheld MiWay’s decision, Otto said.
