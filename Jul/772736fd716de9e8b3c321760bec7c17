The rand was firmer against hard currencies shortly before midday on Monday, supported by global demand for riskier assets that analysts warned may come off later in the week. Analysts said despite a lull in the markets due to the northern hemisphere summer holidays, the rand would remain under pressure as markets increasingly priced in monetary policy tightening. But global equity markets were supported on Monday by the positive US jobs data on Friday, and after minimal geopolitical discord resulted from the Group of 20 meeting, Dow Jones Newswires reported. With all the talk of global policy tightening, comments from various central bank officials would remain in focus this week, said Rand Merchant Bank currency strategist John Cairns. While the local market usually did not care about Canadian monetary policy, if the Bank of Canada proceeded with a widely anticipated interest-rate increase on Wednesday, pressure on the rand could mount even further, he said. Standard Bank currency trader Warrick Butler said the rand was unlikely to recover all its losses from recent domestic political risk events, such as debate on the future of the Reserve Bank. The local currency showed little reaction to the US nonfarm payroll data released on Friday, which showed that 222‚000 jobs were created in June‚ beating the expectation of 178‚000. Hourly earnings climbed only 0.2% on the month‚ below the expected 0.3%. Investors had anticipated that central banks would announce the withdrawal of some stimulus measures, but some policy makers were querying why inflationary pressures had been coming off worldwide despite accelerating economic growth, analysts said. At 11.30am the rand was at R13.3319 to the dollar from Sunday’s R13.4073, at R15.1854 to the euro from R15.2756 and at R17.1553 from R17.2643. The euro was at $1.139 from $1.1397 © Business Day
