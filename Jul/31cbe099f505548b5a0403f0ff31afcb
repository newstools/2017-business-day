Hamburg — England’s Jordan Smith claimed his first European Tour title on Sunday, as he beat defending champion Alexander Levy of France in a play-off at the European Open in Hamburg. Smith had been two shots ahead overnight but he needed a birdie at the last hole to force a play-off, with both players tied at 13 under par. On the first trip back down the 18th Levy missed a close-range birdie putt to win. Back down the 517-yard par-five last hole they came and this time Smith, 24, birdied to take victory in the €2m event. Smith, who turned professional in 2014 and was top-ranked on the Challenge Tour in 2016, shot a one-under-par 71 in the final round. AFP
