Policy uncertainty increased in the second quarter of 2017 with the advent of the recession, Moody’s credit rating downgrade, the release of the new mining charter and the public protector’s report on the role of the Reserve Bank. According to the policy uncertainty index (PUI) released on Tuesday by the North-West University (NWU) School of Business and Governance, the index showed an average score of 53.1, up from 51.0 in the first quarter of 2017. An increase above 50 reflects heightened policy uncertainty while a score below 50 indicates reduced uncertainty. "It’s the cumulative impact that sends a negative message in a climate of low confidence and low growth," Prof Raymond Parsons, an economist at the university, said. "In the second quarter of this year, we’d be lucky to see any growth at all. We might see a growth rate of 0.5% for 2017." While the second quarter index had not taken the ANC policy conference into account, Parsons explained that getting the economics right was dependent on getting the politics right. He added that the public protector’s report calling for a change in the Reserve Bank’s mandate had overreached politically and economically and had had contributed to policy uncertainty. "We’ve paid an economic price for that. The rand took a knock and uncertainty surged." North-West University said in a statement: "These developments will need to be carefully scrutinised to see whether they add to future policy uncertainty and whether [Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba] impresses investors and the markets in particular with his handling of these challenges." Prof Waldo Krugell, director of the school of economics at North-West University, said: "We’re likely to see a further increase in the index. The momentum of the policy conference hasn’t come into the index yet. If [Gigaba] comes up with a whole new plan, that would be the worst thing that can happen. If he sticks to the NDP [National Development Plan], that may help with confidence."
