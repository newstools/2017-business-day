ANC MP Makhosi Khoza will face the wrath of her own party soon‚ with confirmation on Wednesday morning that she has formally been charged. ANC KwaZulu-Natal secretary Super Zuma said the charge sheet had been served on Khoza and that formal disciplinary processes would begin. He would not‚ however‚ provide specifics. Khoza has been a vocal critic of the ANC and has been frequently chastised by her comrades. "We can confirm that she has been served with the charge sheet. She received the charge sheet late [Tuesday] evening or late afternoon. She will appear before a disciplinary committee. This is an independent process so I don’t want to disclose more information‚" said Zuma. He said Khoza could speak openly about the charges she was facing. "We really need to preserve her rights and we don’t want to expose our case. We don’t want a situation where she comes to the disciplinary [hearing] and claims she has been dealt with publicly‚" said Zuma. Khoza did not answer a phone call and WhatsApp message sent on Wednesday morning. Speaking at the Future of SA conference in Johannesburg exactly a week before she received the charge sheet‚ Khoza said President Jacob Zuma had lost "legitimacy‚ credibility‚ integrity and honour". In response‚ the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal said she must "face the consequences of her actions". "The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal is of the firm view that comrade Makhosi Khoza has now crossed the line and must immediately face the consequences of her actions. Comrade Makhosi is a member of the ANC and a deployed MP who is not immune from the political discipline of the ANC. Her public stunt … constitutes a blatant betrayal of the core values of the ANC‚" provincial ANC spokesperson Mdu Ntuli said last week.
