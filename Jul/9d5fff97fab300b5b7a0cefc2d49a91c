Radical economic transformation has been falsely pitted against inclusive growth, or even radical socioeconomic transformation according to Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba. Speaking at the Thomson Reuters economist of the year awards on Thursday at the JSE, Gigaba said radical economic transformation had been criticised for being undefined, a smokescreen for a plot to capture the state or a sign of an impending shift to populist policies, which would spell disaster. "The nature of our public discourse on economic issues is of critical importance. In my view, too much of this discourse is politicised, centred around unhelpful binaries, arguing about concepts over content. The prime example, of course, is the bogey-phrase, radical economic transformation," said Gigaba. "Supporting radical economic change should be ... obvious," he explained. Reiterating his commitment to the National Development Plan (NDP), Gigaba said SA was far from the 5%-6% growth needed to reduce unemployment, inequality and poverty but required a joint effort from business, government and civil society. "Lower than expected growth is likely this year, which will put strain on our fiscal framework. Going into the October medium-term budget policy statement (MTBPS), we will have some tough decisions to make," he said. Gigaba also alluded to the "action plan" for economic growth he was set to announce later on Thursday. He explained that there needed to be a focus on, among other things, ensuring black ownership in emerging sectors of the economy, such as the ocean economy; increasing the scale and scope of research and development (R&D) to facilitate the development of new products and technologies; and ensuring targeted support and improving market access for small, micro and medium-sized enterprises (SMMEs).
