The rand extended earlier gains against hard currencies shortly before midday on Wednesday, lifted slightly by higher commodity prices and a softer dollar. Analysts said the local currency was expected to be range-bound ahead of US Federal Reserve chairperson Janet Yellen’s appearance at Congress on Wednesday night Yellen will address legislators about the unwinding of the Fed’s $4.5-trillion balance sheet, and is widely expected to retain a hawkish tone despite the low-inflationary environment. The local currency would benefit from higher commodity prices, and with some pressure on the dollar, may see gains, said TreasuryOne currency dealer Gerard van der Westhuizen. A tight range could also be expected before Yellen’s comments. The euro, which the rand usually tracks, was little changed against the dollar shortly before midday, but recent strength had enabled it to reach one-year highs against the greenback. Analysts said gold had gained in the past three days after controversy over US president Donald Trump’s son’s e-mails sparked some safe-haven demand. At 11.31am, the rand was at R13.4373 to the dollar from Tuesday’s R13.5588, at R15.3957 to the euro from R15.5473 and at R17.2924 to the pound from R17.4235. The euro was at $1.1456 from $1.1466. Gold was up 0.1% to $1218.50 an ounce and platinum 0.43% to $905.48. The rand has been under recent pressure and seemed to be trending lower with negative sentiment "snowballing", said Rand Merchant Bank currency strategist John Cairns. The rand had now lost between 4% and 10% of its value against other risk currencies in the past month, the smaller figure against other emerging-market currencies. Sentiment may have been a factor for the rand in the morning, but afternoon trade was going to be about global monetary policy, which should see all risk-assets moving together, said Cairns.
