Bengaluru — Gold prices edged lower on Thursday, with the dollar steady as markets looked to a meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) later in the day for clues on the outlook for its stimulus programme. The ECB is expected to lay the groundwork for an northern autumn policy shift when it meets, emphasising improved growth while tempering expectations after previously setting off a mini tantrum in financial markets. That comes after the Bank of Japan (BoJ) on Thursday kept monetary policy steady and pushed back against the timing for achieving its 2% inflation target. "Investors remained cautious heading into [Thursday’s] ECB meeting, where there are expectations of a more hawkish stance," ANZ research said in a note. Spot gold had dropped 0.2% to $1,238.30/oz at 3.41am GMT. US gold futures for August delivery fell 0.3% to $1,237.70/oz. The euro held near a 14-month high against the dollar on Thursday ahead of the ECB gathering. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of trade-weighted peers, was flat. "Overall, a degree of cautiousness is probably warranted in the near-term. But more broadly, a relatively measured move higher with some periods of consolidation should ultimately be healthy for the market," said Joni Teves, strategist for UBS. Spot gold could consolidate in a range of $1,236/oz-$1,244/oz for one day before rising towards $1,249, as suggested by a Fibonacci projection analysis, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Gold prices would be supported as long as recent weakness in the US dollar persisted, said Yuichi Ikemizu, Tokyo branch manager at ICBC Standard Bank. "I don’t really expect prices to go any lower as I think there is support at the $1,200/oz level and people are not so bearish anymore." Meanwhile, holdings at the SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded (ETF) fund fell 0.65% to 816.13 tonnes on Wednesday from 821.45 tonnes on Tuesday. In other precious metals, silver slipped 0.3% to $16.19/oz, after touching its highest in more than two weeks at $16.36. Platinum declined 0.3% to $915.25/oz. Palladium also dropped 0.3%, to $853.00/oz. It hit a three-week high of $872.25/oz in the previous session. Reuters
