The South African bond market was little changed on Monday morning and was stronger than its worst intraday levels on Friday, when the yield on the benchmark R186 bond hit the 9% mark for the first time since early April. The slight improvement in local bonds came as the rand drifted away from last week’s worst levels. "Markets are relatively thin at the moment, which is possibly why the rand moves are so exaggerated, but this will detract from confidence and push bonds into a defensive mode," Sasfin Securities’ head of fixed-income dealing, Ashley Dickinson, said. "We think this will be temporary and the market should settle down going into this week." The closely watched US nonfarm payrolls data generated a fair amount of volatility in the rand on Friday. The jobs report beat expectations on the headline figures — 220,000 jobs were created in June from an expected 177,000 — but growth in wages remained muted, up only 0.2% month on month. This is the outcome that some analysts believe will lead the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates at a moderate pace. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen may provide more clarity when she testifies to the Congress later in the week. The yield on the R186 bond was at 8.90% in early trade, from 8.93% on Friday, as the rand improved to R13.35/$, from lows of R13.50 last week. Higher interest rates in the US have the potential to divert flow from emerging markets, including SA. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note was 2.3866% from 2.3884%.
