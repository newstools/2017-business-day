The national policy conference of the ANC has come and gone. Some within the leadership claim that it was a success, but to what extent was this success? The ANC is known to be a democratic organisation that embraces internal debates. But debates alone are not enough if resolutions are not going to be implemented. This is the problem that has faced the ANC for a very long time. It is, however, fair to note that some policy proposals are progressive. One example is radical economic transformation. However, increasing the child-grant age could be a problem. Where is the money going to come from? SA is spending a lot on grants as things stand. Let’s hope that this time around things will improve and taxpayers’ money will be put to good use. Rhetoric alone won’t put food on the table. Tom MhlangaBraamfontein
