Africa’s major central banks are entering an easing cycle as they try to stimulate growth after months of drought, austerity drives and confidence issues across the continent, a Reuters poll found on Thursday. Much of southern and eastern Africa is still recovering after an El Nino-related drought wilted crops in 2016. Poor business confidence in SA and foreign exchange restrictions in Nigeria have also hampered growth. "We expect that African monetary policy is entering a widespread and protracted period of policy easing. This will provide a boost to growth," said John Ashbourne, Africa analyst at Capital Economics. Ghana, which agreed a three-year fiscal discipline deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in exchange for aid in 2015, cut 100 basis points from its benchmark interest rate in May and is expected to do the same on Monday, putting it at 21.50%. Medians in the poll predict SA will cut rates by 25 basis points to 6.75% in the first quarter of 2018 and while Kenya will hold steady on Monday it is expected to cut 100 basis points to 9% in the second quarter. Nigeria is expected to hold rates at 14.0% on Tuesday, and for 2017, but will reduce borrowing costs by 175 basis points across 2018. Battered confidence chips at growth Aly-Khan Satchu, CEO of Nairobi-based Rich Management, said policy makers in Africa’s biggest economies had lost credibility and it would be difficult to regain that. To try to reduce demand for dollars, Nigeria banned the importing of 41 items, but that only fuelled the gap between the official and black market rates for its naira currency. The policy, alongside a commodity price slump that hurt oil exports, has since 2015 forced its central bank to increase the benchmark rate 300 basis points to 14% as it tried to deal with much faster inflation and restore the currency’s strength. Nigeria — Africa’s biggest economy — fell into recession for the first time in 25 years in 2016 but is expected to turn in growth of 1.0% in 2017 and 2.5% in 2018. SA is expected to escape recession in the second quarter of 2017 and show growth of 0.7% for the whole year. Confidence in SA’s economy has been sapped by the chopping and changing of finance ministers four times since the end of 2015 by President Jacob Zuma. The last change in March triggered a credit rating downgrade to "junk" status. Kenya is expected to grow 5.2% in 2017 and 5.9% in 2018. Growth slowed to 4.7% in the first quarter, hit by a credit slow down after authorities late in 2016 capped the interest banks could charge on loans. However, Ghana is expected to fare better than most, growing 6.1 and 6.8% in 2017 and 2018 respectively, supported by the IMF programme, recovering from 3.5% in 2016. On Tuesday, President Nana Akufo-Addo said Ghana would not extend its three-year aid programme with the IMF beyond April 2018, but the fund urged it to do so to allow time to complete the programme’s goals.
