The JSE opened flat on Wednesday, shrugging off a surge in US markets on Tuesday in which two of the main stock market indices, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, set fresh record highs. The local top 40 and all share indices are near record levels set two years ago. Global markets are waiting for the US Federal Reserve rate decision later in the day. A slightly more hawkish tone is expected, with investors hedging their bets in the bond market, where yields on the US 10-year Treasury bond have risen in anticipation over the past few days. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.47% higher at 21,613.43, just a whisker off its previous high on July 14, as higher oil prices boosted energy stocks. Sentiment was also lifted by better than expected results from Caterpillar and McDonald’s. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.48% on Wednesday, and the Hang Seng rose 0.26% in Hong Kong. Brent crude was little changed at $50.67 a barrel. Analysts questioned the sustainability of Tuesday’s rise, which was based on slower growth in US shale production. Markets continued to overreact to oil cartel Opec and Saudi comments regarding the reduction of crude exports, analysts at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) said. "However, we believe this reaction is premature and likely to be short-lived," Nedbank said, adding that oil was still vulnerable to further downside risks as the supply glut remained firmly entrenched. Commodity prices trended weaker with platinum 0.32% off at $922.52 an ounce and gold down 0.36% to $1,245.25. Resources pushed the JSE to a firmer close on Tuesday, in mixed trade, as a promising start by retailers and banks fizzled out in the late afternoon. Sasol benefited from a weaker rand and resources were marginally up on Wednesday. The all share hit a best level of 55,355.1 on April 24 2015. At 9.34am the all share was 0.03% up at 54,514.70 and the blue-chip top 40 added 0.1%. The platinum index was down 1.03% and the gold index was off 0.35%. Resources added 0.4% and banks 0.25%. Anglo American was 0.18% up at R199.90, but Kumba Iron Ore softened 1.63% to R199.70. Kumba rocketed 17% on Tuesday after announcing it would be paying its first dividend since 2015. Anglo holds 70% of Kumba and will be paid R3.57bn of Kumba’s dividend. Sasol added 1.02% to R391.55. British American Tobacco rose 1.7% to R914.77. Impala Platinum shed 1.01% to R34.35 and Lonmin lost 2.04% to R14.44. Liberty Holdings was 0.04% lower at R113.95 after falling 2% at the opening following the release of an interim update. The life insurer expects normalised headline earnings per share (HEPS) to be 25%-35% lower for the six months to end-June compared with the year-earlier period. Group Five was 2.15% down at R16.82. Among property stocks Liberty Two Degrees rose 2.62% to R9.80. Naspers softened 0.38% to R2,851.45.
