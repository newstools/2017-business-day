SA’s second boat in their stable — a new-look men’s four — on Sunday missed the podium at the World Cup regatta in Lucerne by five-hundredths of a second. SA’s new men’s four featured 2016 Olympic pairs silver medallist Lawrence Brittain and John Smith‚ the last active member of the champion lightweight four crew from London 2012. For David Hunt and Jake Green‚ the two survivors of SA’s boat from Rio‚ it was déjà vu‚ having ended fourth at the Olympics too. But it was no disgrace finishing behind Olympic champions Britain‚ the winners in 5:52.92‚ and Italy‚ the reigning world and European champions who clocked 5:54.42. And they so nearly chased down Netherlands‚ the early leaders at 500m‚ who ended third in 5:54.72. SA were in fifth place for much of the race before launching a trademark late attack and going the fastest over the final 500m‚ although it just was not enough for a medal. On Saturday Kirsty McCann scored another first for South African women’s rowing as she scooped gold in 2,000m course in 7min 45.75sec‚ to lift the lightweight single sculls crown by nearly three seconds over Holland’s Marieke Keijser‚ the under-23 world champion. McCann had purposely held back in the semifinals‚ giving Keijser the win in that round‚ and the Dutch competitor was marginally in front at the halfway mark in the final. That is when McCann opened the throttle‚ powering into the lead by 1.4sec over the third 500m. Patricia Merz of Switzerland‚ the bronze medallist at the recent European championships‚ was third — nearly 5sec behind McCann. European champion Emma Fredh of Sweden was fifth. Double Olympian McCann is the first South African woman to triumph in Lucerne‚ the biggest of the three World Cup regattas. For McCann and the men’s four‚ the main goal this year is the senior world championships in Sarasota-Bradenton‚ Florida‚ US‚ from September 24 to October 1. TimesLIVE
