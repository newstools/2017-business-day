South African bonds were slightly firmer on Tuesday morning as the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee began its three-day deliberation on interest rates. It is widely expected that the Bank will keep the repo rate unchanged at 7% on Thursday when the monetary policy committee announces its decision. Nedbank analysts said that "although expectations appear to be leaning toward an unchanged rate scenario, there will be a keen interest on the tone of projections going forward". Bidvest Bank analysts said in a note that the Reserve Bank had been extremely cautious in the setting of monetary policy in recent months, with policy makers reluctant to start cutting interest rates despite the rapid moderation in consumer inflation and a broader recovery in the rand. Statistics SA will release consumer price index (CPI) data for June on Wednesday. Inflation is expected to have eased further, from 5.4% in May to 5.2% in June. At 9.01am the R186 bond was bid at 8.61% from Monday’s 8.625% and the R207 was at 7.485% from 7.475%. The rand was at R12.9099 to the dollar from R12.9471.
