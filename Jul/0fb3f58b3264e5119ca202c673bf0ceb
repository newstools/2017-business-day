The Sharks will be the team to watch in Saturday’s main game at Craven Week after the rugby lesson they administered to South-Western Districts at St Stithians College in Johannesburg on Thursday. The Bulls were also on the receiving end of a hammering they did not expect. The Sharks took the Eagles apart scoring a 65-26 win, sending out an ominous message to the team — probably the unbeaten Free State or hosts Lions — they meet in Saturday’s main game. Their opponents will be announced on Friday. Their display of pace‚ power and cohesion was too much for South-Western Districts, who put up a spirited display, but were no match for the likes of the Sharks’ Jaden Hendrikse and Sanele Nohamba. JJ van der Mescht‚ Phendulani Buthelezi and Celimpilo Gumede blasted holes in the Eagles defence which the Sharks backs easily exploited. Namibia’s dream Craven Week run was cut short by a ruthless Leopards who romped home 57-30. The North West side scored eight tries with Hanru van Rooyen and Betru Jones grabbing two each. To their credit‚ Namibia never gave up, scoring five tries with Gershwin Mouton among the try scorers. In what was expected to be one of the more competitive encounters‚ Eastern Province made up for their disappointing day two showing hammering the Bulls 37-0. Eastern Province ran incisive lines punishing the Bulls’ defence. The Bulls never looked like scoring as Bevan Prinsloo’s work on the ground denied them clean ball. The hardworking openside flanker scored two tries while Ayabonga Matroos‚ Rodwill Baatjies‚ Juandre Sabbat and Le-Kleu Stokes were the other try scorers.
