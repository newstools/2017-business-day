Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane said an inquiry into state capture must take place urgently, and President Jacob Zuma cannot decide which judge must hear it. Mkhwebane made these calls in her answering affidavit to a court application Zuma made in December to set aside former public protector Thuli Madonsela’s State of Capture report, eNCA reported on Wednesday morning. Mkhwebane’s support of her predecessor’s findings against Zuma was seen by many as another sudden flip-flop following her decision on Monday to abandon an attack on the Reserve Bank. Mkhwebane has in the past been accused of being the "president protector" by the EFF, whose members called on her to resign after the Reserve Bank debacle. "I’m so confused" was a refrain from many South Africans on Twitter in reaction to the news‚ which followed Mkhwebane’s backtracking earlier this week on her recommendation that the Constitution should be amended to change the mandate of the Reserve Bank.
