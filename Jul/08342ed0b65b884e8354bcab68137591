Shares in Kumba Iron Ore were trading lower on the JSE on Wednesday morning, following a 17% spike on Tuesday after the miner said it was resuming dividend payments. Kumba, which operates the Sishen mine in the Northern Cape, Africa’s biggest iron ore mine, said on Tuesday that it planned to resume dividends after a two-year hiatus caused by plunging prices. The payouts would be “discretionary” in the future, rather than based on an earnings ratio, to ensure the ability to weather a downturn, CEO Themba Mkhwanazi said. Kumba shares were trading 1.63% lower at R199.70 on Wednesday morning. Anglo American, Kumba’s majority owner, rose more than 7% on Tuesday, and added another 0.2% on Wednesday morning. Price caution Mkhwanazi, who correctly predicted in February that his company’s commodity would plunge 40%, is wary of the recent recovery in prices. Iron ore has rallied over the past six weeks, topping $70 a tonne on a steel-making recovery in China, the largest user. Prices would probably average $55-$60 a tonne in the second half, Mkhwanazi told Bloomberg. “When you look at fundamentals — port stocks, activity around steel production — it’s very supportive of a price range of $55-$60 a tonne,” Mkhwanazi said on Tuesday. A seasonal resurgence in steel making in China has benefited global low-cost iron-ore miners such as Australia’s Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton, and Brazil’s Vale. But the higher prices had also prompted producers in China and India to increase supply, said Mkhwanazi. “We’re likely to see some moderation because the high-cost supply has now come back in to the market,” he said. He is not alone in forecasting lower prices. Goldman Sachs predicted an average of $47 next year, in a note dated June 29. Australia’s government also forecasts sub-$50 iron ore in 2018.
