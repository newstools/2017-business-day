DA leader Mmusi Maimane has proposed a sovereign wealth fund that could be used to create jobs, and which would be raised by taxing the wealthy in SA. Maimane’s proposal is part of economic reform policies that the DA is working on. In an interview with Business Day on Monday, Maimane said the DA was concerned about the state of the economy and the fact that it was not a priority for the national government. The party’s policies will remain on paper unless it is elected to govern in 2019, which it hopes to do. The wealth fund is among new proposals to grow the economy, "create jobs and a more just society", said Maimane. It could also be used to cushion the economy during difficult periods, he said. It could be drawn from a 2% increase in taxes from the wealthy and large companies. The proposal remains under discussion within DA structures. The DA is also revamping its policies on land and healthcare. Land is set to be a key issue in the 2019 election. Maimane said the DA was preparing for the upcoming polls through doing work in rural areas. It was also working hard to ensure that it governed the metros it won in the 2016 polls well, to ensure that it retained the trust of the electorate, particularly in Gauteng, which it hopes to win in the next election.
