The DA is not letting Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane off for her recent controversial remarks on the role of the South African Reserve Bank. Members of the DA have announced that they would request that Parliament’s justice committee summon her to explain herself. In a media briefing, Mkhwebane directed Parliament to review the powers of the Reserve Bank as well as its mandate to protect the national currency in her investigation into allegations of maladministration affecting Absa. Absa challenged Mkhwebane’s remedial actions in court and they were widely panned as unconstitutional and displaying ignorance of the principle of separation of powers. The office of the public protector has since backtracked in court documents. The DA in Parliament is not convinced, with MP Glynnis Breytenbach announcing that she would write to justice committee chairman Mathole Motshekga, requesting that he summon Mkhwebane to Parliament to explain the mistake that led to the imbroglio. Unacceptable "Mkhwebane has admitted her findings on the mandate of the Reserve Bank were wrong and has put it down to ‘an honest mistake’," said Breytenbach. "This is simply unacceptable and has already cost the South African economy when the rand’s value fell after her latest report and remedial action." Motshekga told Business Day that it would be hasty of the portfolio committee to summon Mkhwebane to address it on issues that were the subject of a legal challenge by Absa bank and other parties. If the public protector felt the need to stand by her remedial actions or to backtrack from them, Motshekga said, she should be allowed to do so within the parameters of the place where that remedial action was being challenged.
