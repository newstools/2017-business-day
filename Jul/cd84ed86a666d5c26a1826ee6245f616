Better than expected US job data released on Friday set a positive tone for Asian markets on Monday morning. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was 1% higher, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index was up 0.8% and Sydney’s S&P/ASX 200 index was 0.33% higher at 7am. The Asian markets took their cue from Wall Street where the Nasdaq index rebounded 1% and the S&P 500 0.64% on Friday after June’s nonfarm payroll figures showed the US added 222,000 jobs, beating the economist’s consensus of 177,000. Stanlib chief economist Kevin Lings said in a note e-mailed on Friday that the US’s impressive employment figures made it likely the Federal Reserve Bank would increase interest rates by a further 25 basis points in 2017. "Over the past three months, US job gains have averaged a solid 194,000 per month. The level of US employment is 7.97-million above the peak prior to the global financial market crisis. During the financial market crisis the US lost a total of 8.7-million jobs. Consequently, the US has created almost 17-million jobs since the financial crisis ended," Lings said. But the US job data, which was released at 2.30pm local time on Friday, failed to cheer up the JSE, which closed 0.74% lower before the weekend break. Bad news in the US job figures was average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by a very modest four US cents to $26.25 in June. "Over the year, average hourly earnings have still risen by only 2.5%, which remains one of the most disappointing components of recent labour market reports. Wage growth is still extremely low by historical standards. Clearly, US wage growth is constrained by structural impediments and is not adding much upward pressure to US inflation despite the low rate of unemployment," Lings said. The rand was slightly stronger at R13.39/$, R15.27/€ and R17.27/£ at 7am on Monday morning.
