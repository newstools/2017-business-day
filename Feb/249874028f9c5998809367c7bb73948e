The National School of Government is grappling with low revenue and disappointing outcomes from training initiatives, MPs in the portfolio committee on public service and administration heard on Wednesday.School chief director for strategy Dino Poonsamy said it had missed targets for training newly appointed public servants and revenue.The school was started in 2013 as part of the government&rsquo;s efforts to professionalise the public service in line with the National Development Plan.Poonsamy said the school had aimed to train 8,955 public servants in its compulsory induction programme and had expected to generate R40m in quarterly revenue.However, the school only trained 3,552 public servants on induction and generated R28m.School principal Prof Richard Levin had sent letters to director Mashwahle Diphofa asking for more trainers.The school was also looking into exploring other sources of funding to make up for its revenue shortfall.Poonsamy said the school planned to implement a prepayment system for departments, which owed it money for training.He said training statistics and revenue generation were being monitored through weekly meetings chaired by the school principal.Four application-of-learning programmes were being implemented to track course outcomes in the public service, Poonsamy said.Committee chairwoman Regina Lesoma urged the school to consider adjustments to its programmes to allow it to extract more revenue out of its training programmes.School chief financial officer Phindile Mkhwanazi said it would pursue and amend its funding model with the National Treasury while it also considered how to reconfigure the programme offering."Some of the courses are voluntary," he said."Our service delivery programme and the inductions programme are the main compulsory programmes we offer. Funding is still a challenge," Mkhwanaz said."We are speaking to [National] Treasury and it is completing its work in terms of how it can assist."
