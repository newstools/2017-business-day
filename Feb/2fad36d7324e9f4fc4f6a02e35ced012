The rand was softer against major currencies on Wednesday morning as investors remain cautious ahead of President Jacob Zumaâ€™s state of the nation address. TreasuryOne currency dealer Andre Botha said the rand had been under pressure this week, slipping 10c against the dollar on Tuesday. The main reason for the weakness was nervousness ahead of the state of the nation address on Thursday, he said. "The rand could trade erratically before and during the address should outside influences disrupt the address." Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking analysts said the lack of data releases meant big moves in the rand were unlikely on Wednesday. They expected the rand to trade between R13.30 and R13.60. At 9.14pm the rand was at R13.4961 to the dollar from R13.4484. It was at R14.3961 against the euro from R14.3643 and at R16.8812 against the pound from R16.8230. The euro was at $1.0666 from $1.0681 the day before.
