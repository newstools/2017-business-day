Former Eskom boss Brian Molefe is an ANC branch member in Irene, the ANC in Tshwane confirmed on Tuesday.ANC Tshwane secretary Paul Mojapelo confirmed to the Business Day that Molefe was a member in good standing of the Irene branch.This raises further questions about the process followed by the party to install Molefe as an MP. He resigned from Eskom late last year in a bid to clear his name after former public protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s State of Capture report highlighted his close ties to the controversial Gupta family.Molefe&rsquo;s nomination as an MP to Parliament was made by the party in the North West as part of replenishing its provincial lists.However, former and current North West leaders have denied that Molefe was a member of the party in that province. The North West provincial leadership claimed that Molefe was a member of the Hartbeespoort branch.Ward 49 branch chairperson Bethuel Mmutle was to hold a media briefing at 12.30pm on Tuesday in which he would clarify issues around Molefe&rsquo;s membership. In a media statement announcing the briefing, he was adamant that Molefe was a member in good standing of his branch in Hartbeespoort.With Carol Paton
