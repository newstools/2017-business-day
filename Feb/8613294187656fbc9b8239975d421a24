Anglo American&rsquo;s profit more than doubled in 2016, and with most commodities rebounding, it is easy to guess why. But the earnings surge has little to do with metals prices. These charts explain the moves:1. While the Bloomberg commodities spot index rose 23% in 2016, prices for the raw materials that Anglo American produces dropped 3%, after weighting for the company&rsquo;s output.2. Cost savings, rather than commodity prices or production growth, were the biggest contributor to Anglo&rsquo;s 25% rise in earnings.3. Employees have been among the hardest hit by Anglo&rsquo;s cost cutting, with headcount falling by 67,000 from 2013 to 2016. About one-third of those workers left the company when Anglo sold the operations where they worked.4. Even after the paper mills, car factories and newspapers of its past were offloaded, CEO Mark Cutifani inherited a sprawling empire of mining assets scattered across the world when he took the CEO role in 2013. Cutifani closed and sold high-cost operations to create a more profitable, focused business and said on February 21 that he was targeting more cuts to leave the company with just 30 assets, without giving a timeframe.5. An engineer by training, Cutifani has ensured production did not suffer when costs were curbed. With volumes up 8% since 2012, economies of scale mean that margins have increased even if commodity prices did not.Bloomberg
