Parliament&rsquo;s finance committee has again dismissed pleas to expand the scope of its consideration of the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment (Fica) Bill beyond the issues raised by President Jacob Zuma, but will tighten provisions relating to warrantless searches.The Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) and the Black Business Council (BBC) had urged a revisiting of the bill passed by Parliament in 2016, calling for it to be scrapped in its entirety and warning that if this did not happen, they would go all the way to challenge the bill in the Constitutional Court.The committee stuck to its guns on Wednesday, limiting its attention to the question of warrantless searches.The Treasury has proposed amendments to the bill that will tighten restrictions on the conduct of warrantless searches. The proposed amendments are based on the legal opinions and public submissions made during the public hearings on the bill held by the finance committee last week.Banking Association SA MD Cas Coovadia said he approved of the proposed amendments and hoped there would be no further delays in sending the bill "expeditiously" back to Zuma for promulgation. Zuma referred the bill back to Parliament in November because of his concerns over the constitutionality of its provision for warrantless searches, which could unjustifiably invade a person&rsquo;s privacy.The amendments presented to Parliament by Treasury chief director for legislation Empie van Schoor specify that inspections can only be conducted to check compliance with provisions of the act or any order, determination or directive made in terms of the act.Searches with a warrant of a private residence will only be allowed if the premises are being used for business purposes. Permission by senior members of the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) or the relevant supervisory and regulatory authorities will have to be obtained before the warrant is applied for, Van Schoor said.With regard to warrantless searches, these can only take place within ordinary business hours or as close to these hours as circumstances permit. Strict regard will have to be paid to decency and good order, including limiting the inspection to only those areas of the premises or objects within them that are reasonably required for inspection purposes. The inspection will have to be conducted "discreetly and with due decorum", cause as little disturbance as possible and be concluded as soon as possible.Treasury deputy director-general Ismail Momoniat said the proposed legal amendments clarified that the enforcement allowed under the act would be limited to administrative enforcement only."FIC and inspectors under FIC law do not have investigative or criminal powers," which could be done only by the South African Police Service and the National Prosecuting Authority, Momoniat said. The FIC Act did not itself criminalise money laundering, racketeering and terror financing, which were addressed by other laws. It only dealt with the laundering of the proceeds of crime.FIC executive manager Pieter Smit explained that FIC inspectors were used on few occasions. Most inspections were conducted by inspectors of the regulatory and supervisory authorities for the different sectors such as banking, insurance and estate agentsHe also noted the FIC had no authority to instruct banks to close accounts on the basis of the suspicious transactions reported to it. It would be up to the banks to decide.Momoniat dismissed the concerns raised by the PPF and the BBC during the public hearings that the effect of the amendments to the bill would be felt mainly by black businesses. There was no factual evidence to support this claim., he said."The FIC must act without fear or favour against anyone breaking the law, black or white. No person who does not break the law has anything to fear," Momoniat stressed.The prominent influential persons who would be subjected to enhanced monitoring were not racially profiled. Instead, the value of business conducted with or on behalf of any organ of state would be the target of enhanced vigilance.
