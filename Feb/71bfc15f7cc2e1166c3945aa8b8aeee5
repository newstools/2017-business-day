New Zealanders will be miffed by this‚ but SA are using their one-day series there as a warm-up for the Champions Trophy in England in June. "These are very much the conditions we’ll be facing in the Champions Trophy‚" Neil McKenzie‚ SA’s batting consultant‚ said on Tuesday in Christchurch, where the second game of the rubber will be played on Wednesday. "This is a hugely contested series for us. We definitely want to get the results here, and if we do, it bodes well for us going to England," he said. But Kiwis will be glad to hear that the South Africans’ high opinion of their team is another reason why the visitors think the series is excellent preparation for the Champions Trophy. "They don’t give you much‚" McKenzie said. "All the New Zealand sides seem like a really close-knit bunch of guys‚ and they really fight. "We’re known for our fighting as well‚ so we can definitely see that quality in the New Zealand side." That was borne out in the first match of the series in Hamilton on Sunday‚ when SA won a tense tussle by four wickets with a ball to spare. The victory was SA’s 12th on the bounce in one-day internationals‚ and a win on Wednesday would set a national record. "We’ve got a certain blueprint we want to try and impose on the other side and a certain game plan we want to achieve‚" McKenzie said. "The 12 wins show that what we’ve been doing over the last year has really worked. "You’ve got to try and play that perfect game. Hopefully that comes in a semifinal or a final‚ but that blueprint has got to have mattered in every game you play," he said. "Something we’ve done is working; the game plan is working." SA’s chances of getting closer to McKenzie’s perfect game were strengthened when David Miller passed a fitness test on the finger injury that has kept him out of SA’s last five short-format matches. But the Kiwis‚ as McKenzie will tell us‚ will not go quietly: the Hamilton defeat was their first loss in five ODIs. TMG Digital
