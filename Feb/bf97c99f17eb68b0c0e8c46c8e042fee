Kumba Iron Ore proposes to give a mine it closed in September to its sole customer, ArcelorMittal SA.ArcelorMittal SA will pay a nominal R1 for Thabazimbi mine, Anglo American&rsquo;s iron ore subsidiary and the South African operation of the world&rsquo;s largest steel maker said in a joint statement on Thursday morning."We will investigate the feasibility of different options to possibly restart operations at the mine in order to supplement the company&rsquo;s sources of iron ore and with the potential of job creation" ArcelorMittal SA CEO Wim De Klerk said.Even without the transfer, ArcelorMittal would be responsible for 96% of Thabazimbi s rehabilitation liability under a "captive mine" agreement with Kumba.The transfer simplified the arrangement by making ArcelorMittal solely responsible for Thabazimbi s closure and rehabilitation, the parties said."In line with our strategy to manage our costs more efficiently in what is a particularly difficult time for the local steel industry, this agreement allows us to take full management control of the processes and costs related to the rehabilitation liability at the Thabazimbi mine," De Klerk said.The mine s remaining 63 employees engaged in its rehabilitation and closure plan would transfer to ArcelorMittal on comparable terms, conditions and benefits."A transfer of the Thabazimbi mine to ArcelorMittal SA demonstrates Kumba s continued support for local beneficiation. This also simplifies the contractual relationship between the parties around the effective management of rehabilitation," Kumba CEO Themba Mkhwanazi said.The deal is subject competition authority approval and transfer of mining rights.
