Stronger-than-expected full-year earnings in the 12 months to end December 2016 saw the Massmart share price surge 10.28% on Thursday to close at a six-month high of R145.25. Head-office cost-cutting and improved merchandising helped to counter the bottom-line effect of muted South African consumer demand and the relatively strong rand, which dulled profit contribution from outside SA. Diluted headline earnings were up 13% to 630.9c per share. Total sales were up 7.7% on the year to R91.3bn. Product inflation of 6.7% and an increase in stores meant like-for-like sales declined in real terms. Trading profit, excluding foreign exchange movements and interest, rose 12% to R26bn. In SA, food and liquor sales grew 11.7%, while general sales increased by only 1.5%. "Very low discretionary spending by consumers" continued to affect general merchandise, the management said. In the rest of Africa, where slightly more than 50% of the group’s sales are general merchandise and home improvement, total sales increased by 3.1% on a like-for-like basis in rand terms. In local currency terms, sales growth in Nigeria and Mozambique were strong. Just under 10% of sales are generated outside SA. CEO Guy Hayward said over the next two years the group’s African footprint would be increased by 25%. "We’re hoping to add five stores a year, with each store contributing R200m a year." The biggest overall improvement came from Massdiscounters, which is Game and DionWired. The division reported a 55% trading profit surge to R364.3m on the back of a 5.3% increase in sales to R20.5bn. Given the underlying product inflation was 4.8% the real increase in sales was 1.5%. Profit surged as the management had put more of the right merchandise into Game stores and had tightened up on in-store and supply chain costs. The introduction of a new SAP point-of-sales system towards the end of financial 2017 should help to sustain the margin improvement during the current financial year. Sasfin analyst Alec Abraham said the results were better than he had expected. The investment in information technology and the implementation of the SAP system had generated strong returns for other retailers and should also help Massmart. Masswarehouse, the largest division in terms of sales and profit, had a disappointing year with an 11% sales increase to R26.3bn and a 4.4% advance in trading profit to R1.2bn. Massbuild’s sales were up 5.6% to R12.7bn and trading profit was up 2.7% to R712.6m. Good cost control at Masscash converted a 7.5% sales increase (to R31.7bn ) into a 28% trading profit hike (to R284.7m).
