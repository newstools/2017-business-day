Even though Mamelodi Sundowns&rsquo; coach Pitso Mosimane is focusing on international football, his team can still win the Premiership, he says.As Downs play TP Mazembe in the 2017 Caf Super Cup at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday&sbquo; further complicating their already manic schedule.Sundowns&sbquo; winners of the 2016 Caf Champions League (ACL), meet Confederation Cup winners Mazembe of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Saturday with Downs having home advantage as winners of the more prestig-ious competition.Mosimane said Downs&rsquo; priority in 2017 is again continental football. "If you want to play in the Club World Cup&sbquo; the Super Cup&sbquo; you want to be team of the year in Africa &ndash; it depends&sbquo; what do you want?" he asked.Downs&rsquo; international priority means that for Mosimane&sbquo; building a team capable of conquering Africa has also given him a side that&sbquo; with a few tweaks and some rotation of a supersquad&sbquo; can come home and earn big results too. Last Saturday&rsquo;s 6-0 thrashing of Orlando Pirates at Loftus was a case in point." My focus is not local football &ndash; it&rsquo;s international football. If my focus was local&sbquo; I would play a weakened team in the Champions League."I play a strong team in the Champions League and then weakened local."And I still have to win the league and it&rsquo;s pressure." The league is a marathon. We know how to do it. If I think if at any time we have to prioritise the league&sbquo; I will. It&rsquo;s very important. And I think we&rsquo;ll win the league."TMG Digital
