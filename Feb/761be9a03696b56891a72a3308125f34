The icy relationship between Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and South African Revenue Service (SARS) commissioner Tom Moyane has been confirmed in 16 confidential letters‚ according to a report on Friday. The Mail & Guardian published the contents of some of the letters‚ after Gordhan this week raised the alarm over the tax collection service’s R30.4bn shortfall — the highest since the 2009 recession. Gordhan delivered his 2017-18 budget in Cape Town on Wednesday. It appears Gordhan’s gripe with SARS’s performance has led to a nasty spat between him and Moyane. Mail & Guardian reported that in the 16 letters‚ dated April 2016 to February 2‚ the pair differ on the powers to approve salary increments and performance bonuses for SARS employees and Moyane’s right to take leave without making an application. In one of the letters Moyane accuses Gordhan of mistreating him so severely in a meeting that he was made to feel like a child‚ the newspaper reported. "I ask myself what I have ever done to you that has made you mistreat and besiege me as if I am a little boy‚" Moyane said. Gordhan reportedly then told Moyane that it was "unethical‚ immoral and illegal" for him to have approved his own performance bonus. The newspaper also reported that Moyane had approached President Jacob Zuma‚ requesting that he intervene in Gordhan’s meddling. SARS spokesperson Sandile Memela told the newspaper SARS would not discuss contents of meetings with the minister with members of the media, and that the letters in the M&G’s possession were confidential. National Treasury had not responded to the newspaper’s request or comment at the time of publication. Gordhan has previously expressed concern over the management of SARS under Moyane‚ but this week said the row between SARS and Treasury should not be turned into a personal battle between him and Moyane. TMG Digital is approaching SARS and Treasury for comment.
