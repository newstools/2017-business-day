Tokyo — Oil prices held steady on Monday as investors gauged whether an increase in US drilling rigs and record stockpiles would undermine efforts by producers to cut output and bring the market into balance. Brent futures were down 5c at $55.75 a barrel at 2.45am GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was unchanged at $53.40. Both contracts earlier rose slightly in quiet trading. "Sustained gains above $55 a barrel, and a hoped for rally to $60 a barrel, [are] both proving incredibly tough nuts to crack," said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. "At the crux of the matter is that 90% Opec compliance is being balanced by ever increasing US shale production," he added. US energy companies added oil rigs for a fifth consecutive week, Baker Hughes said on Friday, extending a nine-month recovery with producers encouraged by higher crude prices, which have traded mostly more than $50 a barrel since late November. Oil cartel Opec and other producers, including Russia, agreed last year to cut output almost 1.8-million barrels a day during the first half of 2017. Estimates indicate compliance with the cuts is at around 90%, while Reuters reported last week that Opec could extend the pact or apply deeper cuts from July if global crude inventories fail to drop enough. But rising US output helped boost crude and petrol inventories to record highs last week, amid faltering demand growth for the motor fuel. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their net long US crude futures and options positions in the week to February14 to a new record high, data from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) showed on Friday. The increase in long positions leaves the market vulnerable to a downward correction, analysts have said. The US market will be closed on Monday for the Presidents’ Day holiday. Reuters
