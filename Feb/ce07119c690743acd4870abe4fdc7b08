Hollywood &mdash; PwC, the accounting firm responsible for tabulating Oscar ballots, apologised for an "error" in the announcement of the best picture award on Sunday, admitting Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were handed the wrong envelope.The embarrassing mix-up saw the Oscar incorrectly given to musical La La Land before the actual winner, coming-of-age drama Moonlight, was handed the prize."We sincerely apologise to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for best picture," the company said."The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and, when discovered, it was immediately corrected."We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred," PwC said, hailing the "grace" with which all concerned had handled the situation.The mistake made for a chaotic end to the film industry&rsquo;s biggest night, on which La La Land went home with six awards including best director, actress, score and song, to three for Moonlight.AFP
