Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane has denied allegations that a man not employed in her department has influenced contracts.EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu wrote to Mokonyane requesting that she respond to the allegations that the man, Luvo Makasi, was responsible for approving payments for contracts in the department despite him not being an employee.The letter was posted on the EFF&rsquo;s website.Shivambu put eight questions to Mokonyane about whether she knew Makasi, whether she had referred any queries about payment for contracts to him, and whether the department had been taken to court over nonpayment of contracts.He asked whether the minister had a personal relationship with Makasi, which allowed him to interfere with operations in her department.This is not the first time Mokonyane has come under scrutiny for contract and tender irregularities.Last year, City Press reported that Mokonyane was in hot water after then-public protector Thuli Madonsela asked the auditor-general&rsquo;s office to investigate "irregularities and improprieties" in relation to the expansion of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project.The newspaper also reported that Mokonyane had been questioned by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) about how engineering consultants LTE Consulting and construction company Khato Civils received water and sanitation tenders worth more than R4bn. The SIU and Mokonyane&rsquo;s office denied this at the time.Mokonyane&rsquo;s department on Thursday denied Makasi was involved in any operational or decision-making process in her department."The allegations, as implied are aimed at tarnishing the name and good image of the minister with an intention to distract her from her responsibilities for nefarious political ends," the department said in a statement."The minister rejects the allegations as unfounded, without factual basis and refuses to be intimidated by such actions for the benefit of EFF financial and political interests and those whose financial fortunes they seek to bolster by such action."It said Mokonyane had formally responded to the EFF s chief whip, and emphasised that Makasi was not employed by the department "or any of its entities", and was "in no way" involved in the department s "operational and decision-making processes".With TMG Digital
