Kumba Iron Ore withheld its full-year dividend despite a strong set of financial results on the back of higher iron ore prices and improved cost controls, citing the uncertain nature of the market for the ingredient used to make steel.Kumba, which is 69.7% owned by Anglo American, said on Tuesday its cash flows increased by a quarter to R17.2bn in the year to end-December compared with the previous year. Kumba paid income tax of R3.4bn for the year compared with R600m before. It also has a tax settlement of R2.5bn to pay the South African Revenue Service (SARS) to settle a tax dispute dating back to 2006.Headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 131% to R27.30. Kumba reported a profit of R11bn for the year compared with R627m the year before.Anglo American has said it wanted to divest from Kumba, SA&rsquo;s largest iron ore producer, which notched up R41bn in revenue for the year, a 13% increase as the iron ore price averaged $64/tonne compared with $53/tonne the year before.Kumba produced its ore at $29/tonne after restructuring its flagship Sishen mine, with the loss of 2,500 jobs during the year, and improved output at its Kolomela mine."While the reinstatement of the dividend is a key priority for the group, the board concluded that it would be prudent to remain ungeared over the short to medium term whilst the period of price volatility continues," Kumba said."Furthermore, in order to maintain balance sheet flexibility in the context of the Anglo American portfolio review, the board has decided not to declare a final 2016 dividend, but will review this again during the course of 2017," it said.Kumba had total production of 41.5-million tonnes for the year, an 8% decline because of the restructuring of Sishen, which included a substantial change to the way the mine was operated to reduce the stripping of waste rock to expose ore.Total sales for the year were 11% lower at 42.5-million tonnes, with export sales of 39.1-million tonnes. The higher iron ore price combined with the rand weakening by 15% against the dollar offset the decline in sales.Kumba chief financial officer Frikkie Kotzee has resigned after five years in the position and will stay with the company until its annual general meeting in May this year.
