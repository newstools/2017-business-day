Artists often create masterpieces by carefully observing situations and social dynamics and then interpreting them in the best way they know. When the art is put on display, it is up to viewers to interact with it and draw their own conclusions.However, Bibliophilia &hellip; Turning the Pages, at the Absa Gallery in central Johannesburg, puts the 16 participating artists at centre stage as subjects of the work they have created. The exhibition explores bibliophilia &mdash; the love of books.The artists, all of whom have been involved in the Absa L&rsquo;Atelier Awards, have each created a book &mdash; a medium not often seen on the contemporary art scene.Bibliophilia &hellip; Turning the Pages focuses on the often intriguing lives of artists as they tell their life stories.Some of their personal journeys are as intriguing as the subjects they usually depict and viewers are afforded a rare opportunity to gain insight into the lives of some of SA&rsquo;s most revered artists."The genre of artist book is very niche in SA and, therefore, we decided to put a spotlight on it through this exhibition," says curator Dawn Roland. "In many ways, the artists have bared their own lives for everyone to see by creating their books."By casually looking at these book objects, one at first might not realise that they are actually reading a book about someone&rsquo;s life. However, by looking more intensely, the message sinks in that, in fact, the artists are talking about themselves and their often complicated and intriguing lives through these art books."The works on display make the artists vulnerable as they are tellingly digging into their deeper selves and portraying that."One piece that seems to tell a deeply personal story is that of Collen Maswanganyi, a highly regarded sculptor from Limpopo and a previous winner of the Absa L&rsquo;Atelier Award.Titled We are Not on the Same Page, the work consists of two mini sculptures of men sitting on top of two open pages. Initially, they appear similar.But the one on the left is wearing purple trousers, a white pair of shoes, a white shirt and a purple tie. The one on the right wears a white pair of shoes, green trousers, a white shirt and green tie.The point the artist seems to be making is that at face value, humans might think we are all the same, but in reality, our different lived experiences inform who we are. For example, we might belong to the same race, but that does not mean we agree on all issues.Another piece of work that tells a painful personal story is Lyndi Sales&rsquo;s charcoal portrait of a woman shaving off her hair."This is about a woman who is undergoing stress of sorts, yearning for a renewal of her life," says Roland. "One way of undergoing that renewal is to shave off their hair."The exhibition is not only about pain. Kathleen Sawyer&rsquo;s Bedtime Stories is a series of books with delicate ballpoint-pen drawings and sketchbook cut-outs. She takes Eurocentric fairy tales as a departure point for a visual discussion of her most enduring motifs."My intention was to investigate the relevance of the fairy-tale genre to a contemporary audience that may not necessarily relate to the archaic references and history of the trope," says Sawyer."Focusing primarily on sexuality and gendered power relations, the work identifies how these themes are presented in fairy tales, using this as a non-representational basis for the content of the work."Consequently, the pieces are not direct illustrations of the stories themselves, but allusive meditations on the thematic elements and how these are still prevalent in contemporary culture," says Sawyer.Shenaz Mohamed delves into religion by creating a piece of work that represents the Qur&rsquo;an in which, she says, 91% of the book content is about love, peace and compassion.Well-known sculptor Gordon Froud created his story about a journey he took last year, when he scoured the streets of London for discarded objects that he picked up, cleaned and fashioned into a fascinating narrative.The featured artists have used the traditional structure of a book and the contemporary interpretation of book objects to produce the limited-edition artists&rsquo; books on show.Participating artists include Stephen Rosin, Neil Nieuwoudt, Banele Khoza, Barbara Wildenboer, Stephan Erasmus, Maswanganyi, Angelique Koekemoer, Michael Meyersfeld, Bongani Njalo, Froud, Sales and Martin Onyis.&bull; Bibliophilia &hellip; Turning the Pages is at the Absa Gallery until March 10
