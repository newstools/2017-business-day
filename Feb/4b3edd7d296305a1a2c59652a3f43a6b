Northam has struck what is arguably the deal of the year, buying the mothballed Eland platinum mine for R175m cash, with the equipment alone worth more than R100m of that price. This reflects the poor investment and mining decisions made by previous Eland owner Xstrata, which bought the mine for $1bn (today worth approximately R13bn) from Loucas Pouroulis in 2007. Glencore, a global marketing and mining company, which acquired Xstrata, has made it clear that platinum was not a commodity it had any interest in and wanted to dispose of as quickly as possible. “On the face of it, it looks like we stole something from Glencore,” said Northam CEO Paul Dunne, commenting on the low price. “That’s not the case.
