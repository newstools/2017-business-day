South African Darren Fichardt&nbsp;birdied the last hole on Sunday for a final-round 68 and a one-stroke victory in a rain-affected Joburg Open.The European Tour event was reduced from 72 holes to 54 after the first three days of the championship were interrupted by torrential rain.Fichardt not only topped the Royal Johannesburg and Kensington Golf Club leaderboard, but also claimed one of three 2017 British Open places.The other two invitations to the Major at Royal Birkdale were taken by the Joburg Open runners-up Paul Waring of England and Stuart Manley of Wales.Fichardt shot rounds of 66, 66 and 68 for a 15-under total of 200 over a course that resembled marshland in places.Waring closed with a 69 and Manley with a 67 for totals of 201. It was the fifth European Tour success for 41-year-old Pretoria-born Fichardt, and his first since lifting the Africa Open trophy four years ago."This was a tough final round," admitted the South African who changed his putter and putting grip last week after months of frustration."I could not hole a putt to save my life in recent weeks," he admitted. "My old putter had suffered a lot and needed a holiday," joked the champion. "I gave it to my son&hellip;."I did not putt very well today and was outdriven at every hole by my two playing partners, but I stuck in there."AFP
