Construction and infrastructure development group Accéntuate reported on Monday that interim revenue were down 7.9% to R159.3m for the six months to end-December. Accéntuate said the reporting period had been one of the most difficult for the company. Profit aftertax halved to R3.4m from R6.8m in the year-earlier period. Accéntuate blamed this partly on the local elections, which took place during the reporting period. Orders at its largest subsidiary, FloorworX, fell considerably due to disruptions during the elections. "The impact of the municipal election held during the period under review was particularly dramatic, with the lag being even longer than in previous elections in metros where a change in the ruling party and administration were made. This impact, coupled with the negative GDP growth in the manufacturing, mining and construction sectors, resulted in reduced trading activity," Accéntuate said in its interim results statement. The group said that the extended lag in the implementation of government infrastructure projects, particularly in transitioning metros, was over despite some planned projects not being undertaken due to financial pressures in certain metros. The group did not declare an interim dividend In its Sens announcement, the group also made mention of Louis Schreuder, the former financial director of FloorworX, who was found guilty on all counts of fraud in the regional court in East London and received an 18-year prison sentence. A confiscation order has been granted over certain of Schreuder’s assets and the first auction was held in December 2016 to liquidate most of these assets. Further legal steps are in progress to realise the remaining identified assets, and further attachment awards have been granted which are subject to ratification by the High Court.
