The National Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations (DPCI) Lieutenant-General Mthandazo Ntlemeza says that if private investigator Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan has any dots to join&sbquo; he should do so within the ambit of the law and stop &ldquo;feeding the residents of this country with well-orchestrated lies through his partisan media&rdquo;.In a statement on Sunday&sbquo; the Hawks said Ntlemeza had noted with &ldquo;absolute bewilderment&rdquo; media reports as well as the so-called &lsquo;Joining The Dots&rsquo; document on the alleged capture of the criminal justice system prepared by O&rsquo;Sullivan.&ldquo;Of all the things that this so called document had speculated&sbquo; Lieutenant-General Ntlemeza is more concerned about the malicious&sbquo; baseless accusations which seeks to compromise or to undermine the sovereignty of the country&sbquo; calculatingly destabilise the Justice system&sbquo; make wild accusations against senior government officials&sbquo; journalists&sbquo; business people and more importantly denting the image of the South African Police Service (SAPS) and the DPCI&sbquo; the elite crime fighting unit which he leads&sbquo;&rdquo; the statement read.&ldquo;With O&rsquo;Sullivan having proved himself over the years that he is too forward and never thinks twice in his endless attempts to claim glory; if the contents of his so-called report had any substance&sbquo; the man would have already opened hundreds of dockets against the people he had pointed fingers at&sbquo; in his document&sbquo;&rdquo; it added.It stated that O&rsquo;Sullivan was prepared and would &ldquo;stop at nothing&rdquo; in his quest to tarnish the image of the Hawks&sbquo; the integrity of the Justice System and reverse all the gains the country had attained post 1994.&ldquo;If the dots he apparently joined thus far proves some degree of criminality against certain individuals&sbquo; why doesn&rsquo;t Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan &lsquo;Join The Dots&rsquo; the right way?&ldquo;His continuous attempts to turn the people of this country against the Government&sbquo; credible institutions and private individuals that have the best interests of justice at heart have been tamed&sbquo; and at best&sbquo; to be ineffective.&ldquo;His modus operandi of digging people&rsquo;s dirt&sbquo; dragging their names through the mud&sbquo; accusing them of non-existent crimes and seeking public sympathy has been overdone and the National Head of the DPCI challenges Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan and his community of liars to put their money where their mouth is&sbquo;&rdquo; the Hawks said in their statement.&ldquo;If Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan is as learned as he claims to be together with his cabal&sbquo; they should know the simple procedure of laying criminal charges here in South Africa. Their media might assist in spreading the rumours but will definitely not criminally charge anyone&sbquo;&rdquo; the statement added.Saying that as the Hawks they had &ldquo;been there&sbquo; done that and got all the t-shirts&rdquo;&sbquo; they said that &ldquo;no stunts that Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan or anyone for that matter will derail us from detecting&sbquo; combating and investigating serious corruption&sbquo; serious organised crime and serious commercial crime&rdquo;.&ldquo;By releasing his &lsquo;report&rsquo; we believe that Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan has already joined his dots and by now he should have laid charges against all his so called suspects&sbquo;&rdquo; the Hawks added.- TMG Digital
