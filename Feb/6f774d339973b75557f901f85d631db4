Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela has hit back at the &ldquo;lies&rdquo; and &ldquo;false news&rdquo; purportedly spread by her successor Busisiwe Mkhwebane.Speaking to the Citizen&sbquo; Madonsela responded to comments made by Mkhwebane on Thursday&sbquo; when she addressed journalists on her first 100 days in office.Mkhwebane said she got off to &ldquo;bumpy start&rdquo; as a result of the negative news reports which referred to her as a spy&sbquo; a Gupta puppet and a President Protector.She also acknowledged she was stepping into big shoes&sbquo; due to the popularity of her predecessor&sbquo; Madonsela.Madonsela told the Citizen Mkhwebane's press conference was the last straw.Madonsela denied owing almost R500 000 to the state after her son crashed her state-provided BMW years ago&sbquo; after driving it without her permission.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noted the false news about the car and Advocate Mkhwebane and I supposedly working together. I&rsquo;ve maintained silence because I believe that&rsquo;s a proper thing to do but it&rsquo;s not true that I still have to pay the money for the car or that I abused any car&sbquo;" Madonsela told The Citizen."On the car being used after [my time in] office&sbquo; I was given a letter from VIP Protection at SAPS to do so and advised by the head at a meeting on 14 October. She never objected to me&sbquo; asked for the car or indicated I would be charged [an amount of money]&sbquo;" Madonsela said.Madonsela's shadow has loomed large over Mkhwebane's term in office&sbquo; since the former public protector released her State of Capture report on her final day in office&sbquo; leaving the incumbent to handle the subsequent fall-out.Mkhwebane came under fire over staff suddenly departing the office. She also told Parliament that morale was low among staff at the office - a move that some commentators interpreted as a dig at Madonsela.- TMG Digital
