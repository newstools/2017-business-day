Aveng’s share price was down only 0.98% on Friday’s close, despite the group reporting that revenues plunged 21% to R14.3bn in the six months to December from the same period in 2015. The JSE-listed construction and engineering firm, which surprised the market on Monday by releasing its results a day early, reported an adjusted headline loss of R76m in the period compared with a headline loss of R231m for the comparative half-year. A voluntary settlement agreement with the government on transformation in the industry would cost Aveng R165m. It said on Monday it would pay out R21.25m a year over the next 12 years in this regard. As part of the transformation agreement, Aveng had in late 2016 concluded a binding agreement with Kutana Construction, in which a 51% beneficial interest in its loss-making Aveng Grinaker-LTA business would be sold to black-owned interests. With the inclusion of Aveng Water, the net asset value of the business was R71m, and the net loss after tax was R343m for the year to June 2016. Meanwhile, Aveng had also disposed of one of its Aveng Steel businesses. Aveng Steeledale would in future be 70% owned by Kutana. The sale of Aveng Trident Steel was still pending. The group also said an award on the long outstanding claims on the problem Queensland Curtis Liquid Natural Gas contract was expected in the current financial year.
