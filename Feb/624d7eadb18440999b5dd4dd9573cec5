President Jacob Zuma is set for another tense showdown in Parliament on Thursday when he delivers what will be his last state of the nation address (Sona) as ANC president.The build-up to the address has been anything but smooth. Instead of it being dominated by discussion about government policy and Zuma&#8217;s questionable legacy, it has lurched from one controversy and confusion to another, with opposition parties and journalists raising concerns about the securitisation of Parliament.The EFF, which has disrupted Zuma on several occasions in Parliament, has made it clear that it will interrupt the president&#8217;s speech again on Thursday. The party said Zuma should not be allowed to speak.Instead, the EFF said, the day should be used to debate Parliament&#8217;s inability to hold Zuma to account despite a clear ruling by the Constitutional Court that he had failed to uphold his oath of office.
