If one had to judge her performance in the opening round of the Cape Town Ladies Open on Tuesday, the honeymoon might be over, but Ashleigh Buhai is having a whale of a time after giving her husband the boot. The couple tied the knot last December, but after seven years of carrying her bag, David got the boot after last week’s Ladies Tshwane Open. "We’ve split up, but only on the golf course," said Buhai after she and new bagman Johan Swanepoel toured the par-74 layout at Royal Cape Golf Club layout in three under. England’s Lauren Taylor and former Cape Town Open champion Stacy Bregman spoiled their chances to a share of the lead with a pair of bogeys at 17 to finish a shot shy of Buhai. Hannah Arnold from the US and Tandi von Ruben tied for fourth at one under, with defending champion Lee-Anne Pace a further stroke adrift at even-par 74. It was hardly surprising to see Buhai in the lead. She enjoyed runner-up finishes in her first three starts season – the SA Women’s Masters, SA Women’s Open and Ladies Tshwane Open last week, but now the pressure is on Swanepoel to walk her into the winner’s circle on Thursday. "I’d love for us to get that first win this week," Buhai said.
