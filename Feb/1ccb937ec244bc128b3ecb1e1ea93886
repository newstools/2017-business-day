The DA forced the select committee on security and justice to stall the adoption of the Protected Disclosures Amendment Bill when the party walked out of a meeting to discuss the draft law on Thursday.The bill is aimed at providing protection for whistle-blowers in the private sector and in public service. It has been debated in the National Assembly and there is consensus the draft law would serve as a critical addition to the fight against corruption.Although the ANC supports the amendment bill in its entirety, the DA and other opposition parties fear a clause that criminalises false disclosures will discourage whistle-blowing.Section 9b of the amendment bill reads: "An employee or worker who intentionally discloses false information knowing that information to be false &hellip; is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or to both a fine and such imprisonment."DA MP Johan Londt said that in its current form, the bill was unacceptable to the party. "[It] ... can be an excellent bill, but with the inclusion of section 9b, it becomes less [so] ..."ANC MPs would not entertain a discussion on changing contentious aspects of the draft law, prompting the walkout.Mziwenkosi Mthethwa, an ANC MP, said section 9b of the bill protected those wrongly accused of corruption from blackmail and extortion."It is critical to deter the challenge where people come and blackmail individuals and use the Protected Disclosures Amendment Bill to get away with murder."These people are out there and this law cannot be used to protect them," said Mthethwa.ANC MP Jihad Mohapi said any whistle-blower who had a legitimate case of corruption to disclose had nothing to fear, even with section 9b included.When it became clear the two DA MPs in the meeting were outnumbered, the opposition party pulled out, leaving four members and the chairman. Six members including the chairman, were needed to quorate the meeting.The next likely opportunity for the committee to adopt the bill will be in two weeks.
