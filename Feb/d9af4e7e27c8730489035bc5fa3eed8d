The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is considering several proposals to support small-scale fishers, including giving them priority in the remaining allocations of lobster and abalone.Abalone has a high market value and is one of the most sought-after delicacies locally and abroad.Commercial rights had yet to be allocated for abalone and lobster, department officials told Parliament on Tuesday. Assessment teams had recently started processing applications.The department appeared before Parliament&rsquo;s portfolio committee on agriculture, forestry and fisheries to respond to issues raised by the small-scale fishermen during public hearings late in 2016. Parliament held hearings on the sector&rsquo;s state of readiness to participate in the implementation of the Small Scale Fisheries Policy, which aims to "provide redress and recognition to the rights of small-scale fishermen".During the hearings, Cosatu said that it would lobby for the shifting of quotas. The union federation called on the government to reserve the allocation of abalone in favour of small-scale fishing communities.The department said it was considering a proposal that it prioritise small-scale fisheries in the remaining allocations of lobster and abalone.It was considering the suggestion that small-scale fishing rights be given the maximum validity period, which is 15 years &mdash; the same duration given to the commercial sector.A suggestion on the table is to revoke commercial rights of right holders that are not effectively using their rights or are not compliant and to provide a mechanism to transfer the rights to fishing co-operatives.Abongile Ngqongwa, the department&rsquo;s deputy director of small-scale fisheries, said commercial rights could not simply be revoked to make provision for the small-scale fishing sector as this would invite legal challenges. The department was mandated to make allocations that were sustainable so as to prevent overfishing and to ensure that the fisheries sector as a whole did not collapse.The department said the near-shore commercial fisheries, which are mainly small and medium enterprises, competed for resources with the small-scale fishery sector. The commercial species that are of interest to both sectors include linefish, West Coast rock lobster, abalone, netfish, oysters, white mussel, squid and hake.A number of these resources were allocated in terms of previous rights allocation processes. These rights expire in 2020. Furthermore, commercial rights that expire in 2028 have been allocated in netfish, seaweed and beach seine.In 2016, the president signed into law the Marine Living Resources Amendment Act, which recognises small-scale fishermen who were previously marginalised by the process followed in the allocation of fishing rights.
