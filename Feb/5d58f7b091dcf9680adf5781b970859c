Player ill-discipline claims at Orlando Pirates that have been made by caretaker-coach Augusto Palacios are a cop-out, says chairman Irvin Khoza.Khoza held a meeting with the first team on Tuesday to discuss taking responsibility in the wake of Bucs&rsquo; disastrous 6-0 thrashing at the hands of Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday&sbquo; a result that sparked a violent pitch invasion by Pirates&rsquo; fans.Khoza said on Monday that Bucs would speed up their search for a replacement for Muhsin Ertugral&sbquo; who resigned to leave Palacios as caretaker in November. Palacios&rsquo;s claims that indiscipline and players not caring enough about losing were an excuse by the caretaker coach for poor results, he said."And I&rsquo;m disappointed if ever he&rsquo;s punting that narrative. Because he should be the one assisting us&sbquo; from his experience and his knowledge of the game&sbquo; to come up and give us the factors that will assist us."If you start punting reasons, it might be taking the focus away from yourself&sbquo; because we end up auditing you also."Because as a coach he has a responsibility to assist us to understand. Because he has been there for some time as an insider. Help us because you are close to the players."So, don&rsquo;t give us reasons that are going to justify maybe your shortcomings. I can&rsquo;t buy that one. It&rsquo;s a nice easy way for him [to deflect attention]&sbquo; I&rsquo;m afraid."Khoza did say he would meet with Bucs&rsquo; players to discuss the issue of taking responsibility."I will be having a meeting [on Tuesday] with the whole team&sbquo;" Bucs&rsquo; chairman said.Khoza&rsquo;s comments on long-time development servant Palacios, often the fireman in a head-coaching crisis, come as a surprise to many &mdash; an indication of the level of dissatisfaction at Pirates.TMG Digital
