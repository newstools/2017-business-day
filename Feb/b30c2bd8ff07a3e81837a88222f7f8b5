Berlin â€” Weaker output in manufacturing and construction drove the biggest monthly drop in German industrial production in nearly eight years, data showed on Tuesday. Industrial output fell by 3% on the month, data from the economy ministry showed. This was much weaker than the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a rise of 0.3% and the steepest drop since January 2009. The fall was due to a 3.4% drop in manufacturing output and a 1.7% decrease in construction. The November reading was revised up to a rise of 0.5% from a previously reported rise of 0.4%, helping quarterly output to decline by just 0.1%. "Orders in manufacturing and construction and also sentiment indicators in these sectors are signalling a revival of output growth in coming months," the economy ministry said. Reuters
