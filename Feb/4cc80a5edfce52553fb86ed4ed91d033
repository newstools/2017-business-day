Royal Bafokeng Platinum (RBPlat) expects to report a return to profit for 2016. But its rebound was not as good as investors appeared to have expected, and its share price plunged 5.6% to R49.75 after it issued its trading update on Thursday.RBPlat expects to report on February 28 headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the year to end-December of between 80c and 91c. It reported a headline loss per share of 83.2 for 2015.The rebound in earnings was partly due to the previous year&rsquo;s results suffering from the settlement of a tax dispute with the South African Revenue Service (SARS), the company said in its trading statement.Higher platinum group metals (PGMs) prices in 2016 helped revenue grow 9.8%."The improved earnings combined with a strong cash flow contribution from on-reef development revenue at the Styldrift I project resulted in the group having a substantial cash balance at the end of the year," RBPlat said."Cash preservation continues to be a priority and RBPlat remains unleveraged with a robust balance sheet which positions it well for the next phase of Styldrift I&rsquo;s ramp-up to a 150,000 tonnes per month operation."
