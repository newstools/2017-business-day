The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have a long way to go before they can emulate the EFC&sbquo; the mixed martial arts brand.The honourable member who threw the first punch while being pushed by the White Shirt brigade had his fist wrapped around a plastic water bottle.Many street-fighters use knuckledusters or broken glass bottles&sbquo; but a plastic water bottle must be a first.Was he planning on drowning his opponent&sbquo; or actually trying to help resuscitate him mid-fight&sbquo; like a trainer does to a boxer at the end of each round?The hard hats used by some of his teammates seemed a little bit more effective&sbquo; but their throw-and-run tactic wasn&rsquo;t sustainable.Remember the "one settler one bullet" cry of the PAC? Well&sbquo; "one White Shirt&sbquo; one hat" doesn&rsquo;t quite have the same ring &mdash; and we could see why. Generally&sbquo; soldiers carry more bullets than hats.And spare a thought for EFF commander-in-chief Julius Malema. He stood like a true pacifist&sbquo; holding his bottle of water with peaceful intent as he watched the White Shirts storm into his comrades."You can kill me. It&rsquo;s fine&sbquo; kill me. Just kill me&sbquo; there&rsquo;s no problem&sbquo; kill me&sbquo;" he told the speaker&sbquo; before being driven several metres up-house by a sneaky White Shirt attack from the rear.Given what spectators pay in tax&sbquo; this rumble was substandard &mdash; all they got was a whole lot of wrestling&sbquo; hat-throwing and one inEFFective punch.Maybe next time someone should try a roundhouse punch or kick&sbquo; seeing this is Parliament?TMG Sport
