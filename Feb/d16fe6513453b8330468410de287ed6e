Jockey Anton Marcus makes no secret of the fact that his major goal is winning big races and he has been highly successful in an illustrious career.Apart from many feature wins in SA including four Durban Julys, Marcus has won group races in Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai. On Saturday Marcus makes the trip to Kenilworth to partner Just Sensual for the Joe Ramsden stable in the grade3 Vasco Tasco Taverna Prix Du Cap and Marcus knows his mount is talented as he was in the saddle when the filly captured the Cape Fillies Guineas.Frankie Dettori rode Just Sensual in the CTS Mile, but the three-year-old faded in the run-in to finish out of the placings.Marcus will be well aware that Just Sensual faces a tough rival in Silver Mountain, one of four runners from the stable of Candice Bass-Robinson.Winner of last season&rsquo;s Cape Fillies Guineas, Silver Mountain disappointed her backers when she finished only fifth behind stablemate Nightingale.As revealed by Business Day last week, Aldo Domeyer has been appointed first-choice jockey for the Bass-Robinson yard and gets a quick chance to impress on Silver Mountain, who is a filly he knows well.Goodtime Gal, who finished third in the Klawervlei Majorca Stakes, will have her supporters with Richard Fourie booked to partner Michael Robinson&rsquo;s runner. However, Fourie will have to overcome a wide draw. The other Bass-Robinson fillies in the field are Come Fly With Me, Miss Marker and Whose That Girl, but Silver Mountain will be the stable elect.Turffontein hosts a nine-race programme on Saturday and the fifth race could provide a close finish between Stuart Pettigrew&rsquo;s runner Secret Star and Anthony Delpech&rsquo;s mount Dame Eleanor. Jackman exited the maidens last time out and it will be interesting to see how Brian Wiid&rsquo;s charge fares on his handicap debut in the sixth race.Although this event &mdash; confined to apprentices &mdash; does look wide open, Jackman should be in the shake-up along with Vee Man and Geoff Woodruff&rsquo;s consistent performer, Duzi Moon.Gavin Lerena rides Polly Wolly Doodle in the third race and Candice Dawson&rsquo;s runner gets the vote to beat home Return To Power and Flying Dream.
