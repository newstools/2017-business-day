If Edgar Marutlulle&rsquo;s enthusiasm is anything to go by&sbquo; the No2 hooker slot at the Bulls will be keenly contested.Retired Springbok captain Adriaan Strauss will be out of action for the first two to three weeks of Super Rugby&sbquo; opening up the hooker berth.It is highly likely Marutlulle will play second fiddle to Jaco Visagie but if he becomes the star of the show like he was for the Southern Kings last season&sbquo; Bulls coach Nollis Marais may have a delightful problem."I came to the Bulls knowing there&rsquo;s competition left&sbquo; right and centre&sbquo;" Marutlulle said."It&rsquo;s going to make me a better player in terms of how I see the game because the pressures here are completely different from the ones I experienced at the Southern Kings."I hope I can learn a lot from Adriaan and I hope I can teach him a couple of things because we&rsquo;re two different players."After all&sbquo; when the Bulls signed me&sbquo; I think they knew what they had and what they expected from me."The Stormers may boast having lineout royalty in Pieter-Steph du Toit and Eben Etzebeth but the threat that looms from the Bulls cannot be underestimated. RG Snyman has come on in leaps and bounds alongside Jason Jenkins and Abongile Nokontwana.There is also the significant matter of Lood de Jager&sbquo; who will lead the Bulls lineout charge in what will be a mini-audition for Springbok places for the three-match series against France later this year.The lineout battle will be one of the many subplots of Saturday&rsquo;s match at Newlands.It is a war Marutlulle is priming himself for and hopes his locks and the rest of the forwards will make the most of the occasion.The Bulls have not found Newlands to be very welcoming in recent years."The Bulls were the No1 side in terms of lineouts and I&rsquo;m really excited to be working with these guys."All of them are world class and that includes every single player in the Bulls unit. Working with them is something that excites me&sbquo;" Marutlulle said.TMG Digital
