Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise hosted an exhibition of 150 iconic South African LP cover designs in September 2016 at which Rob Allingham, Gallo Music archive manager from the &rsquo;80s to 2006 and an avid record collector, presented a history of the record industry.The first patentable and proficient method for recording sound was invented by Thomas Edison in 1877. By 1900, an estimated 3-million LPs were being sold annually; by 1920, annual sales had reached 100-million.SA&rsquo;s market took a little longer to mature.By 1969, South Africans had bought 7.5-million LPs, of which 20% were by local artists. The arrival of cassettes in 1971 and CDs in 1988 flattened LP sales.Eddie Veale, a master acoustician and sound designer since the late &rsquo;60s, identifies three main drivers of change: the quest for sonic excellence, the need to increase the number of recording tracks and the rush for digital solutions."Digital is great for archiving and moving material around &hellip; [but] humans are analogue and very complex. That is why we are seeing a revival of the vinyl record," he says.LPs&rsquo; high-fidelity sound has given the revival of vinyl the appearance of a slow music movement. The revival is reflected in the plethora of second-hand dealers, independent labels such as Roaster Records and vinyl releases by artists such as Derek Gripper.But vinyl costs more than digital downloads.Mabu Vinyl is a landmark Cape Town record store that featured in the documentary Searching for Sugarman. Stephen "Sugar" Segerman founded Mabu Vinyl 16 years ago and expanded his store to include a basement and eBay presence."Vinyl never went away &mdash; both among older collectors who still look for pop, rock, soul and jazz LPs and the new era of DJ culture where DJs play 12-inch extended dance mixes on multi-turntables at parties," Segerman said.Composer, producer and legendary founder of Kalahari Surfers Warrick Sony is another keen enthusiast."The LP format is, in many people&rsquo;s minds, the best way to communicate and market one&rsquo;s music. The artists realise their words, music and artwork in a format that spans a manageable 40 minutes &mdash; unlike the 60 minutes of CD &mdash; and is broken up to 20 minutes per side."It is a very specific creative skill putting together a good LP, involving careful editing, mastering and track order-selection designed to keep the listener interested for the duration," Sony says.Sony points out the rarity factor &mdash; LPs are printed in limited editions. The "warmth" of the sound is also important.Digital RevenueDigital revenue spurred on by streaming, which rose by 45%, overtook physical revenue for the first time in 2016. Global digital revenue increased 10% to more than $6bn.CD sales were down 10%, as were digital downloads.Composer and producer Gabi le Roux is optimistic about trends. "Streaming is the current doorway to the next phase in the ever-changing digital distribution model of music," she says."I do believe there will soon be a realistic and functional method once again of generating high revenue streams from digital music consumption."In SA, radio play still dominates as the main medium for the mass market to access music. Performance rights are a stable part of the music industry, accounting for 14% of revenue, and are the most practical way for composers to earn an income and for performers to reach the public.The recording industry has always been closely connected to radio. Allingham says, "Playing gramophone records as a way of introducing an artist to the public was a big part of the programme." To supplement the loss in download and CD revenue, major record labels have increased their investment in marketing and promotion, and focused on ancillary sales such as merchandise.Brand alignments are also becoming more common. "Get the music to the fans simply and cost-effectively in a market where music is a disposable commodity, changing daily and largely dependent on peer recognition and credibility and following the latest trends and brands," says Gallo&rsquo;s label manager, Rob Cowling."The album is gone &mdash; it&rsquo;s about singles, songs, staying new and relevant and constantly current. The music industry now moves very fast; it&rsquo;s tough to keep your sounds in people&rsquo;s heads and constantly deliver new material."The rise in vinyl is part of the backlash against "fast music"."I think artists are fed up with giving their music away and seeing their hard work being selected, re-edited and generally consumed in playlists like chewing gum and tossed away to make way for something new," says Sony.Le Roux sees it differently: "Vinyl will simply be replaced by software solutions that will allow active users to programme their preferences."
