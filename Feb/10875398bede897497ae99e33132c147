Stormers coach Robbie Fleck sprung a few surprises by picking EW Viljoen at centre and SP Marais at fullback for Saturday&rsquo;s Super Rugby opener against the Bulls at Newlands.As a result of Marais&rsquo;s shift to the No15 jersey, Cheslin Kolbe will start in the unaccustomed right wing position. Viljoen will make his Super Rugby debut while Marais, reserve hooker Ramone Samuels and reserve utility back Dan Kriel will make their Stormers debuts."SP has been around and he has experience," Fleck said. "He is a quality rugby player&hellip;. He knows how to deal with the Bulls, having played for them."In the pre-season, SP and Cheslin formed a good combination. It&rsquo;s to do with our kicking combinations," he said."EW was very good in the Currie Cup last year before injury and two years back he was the best No13 at under-21 in SA. He&rsquo;s really talented."Up front, Bok tighthead Frans Malherbe has been left on the bench with Wilco Louw preferred while Rynhardt Elstadt starts at openside flank. Jean-Luc du Plessis won the battle for the flyhalf jersey over Rob du Preez in another significant team selection."Wilco had an excellent pre-season he worked hard and he is rewarded for that. Frans is coming back from a big neck injury so we are easing him into it," Fleck said."It s always tough on every position and flyhalf was no different. It s been tough on Kurt Coleman too, who is in the best condition of his life."Captain Siya Kolisi dismissed suggestions that the back row lacked balance with Elstadt in the openside role. "We all know our strengths and weaknesses; we know our job and everybody is a fetcher nowadays," he said.TMG Digital
