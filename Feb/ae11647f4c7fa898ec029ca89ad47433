London &mdash; Oil prices rose on Thursday, supported by an unexpected draw in US petrol inventories, although bloated crude supply meant fuel markets remain under pressure.Benchmark Brent crude was up 50c a barrel at $55.62 a barrel by 9.45am GMT. US light crude was 50c higher at $52.84 a barrel.The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday petrol inventories fell by 869,000 barrels last week to 256.2-million barrels, versus analyst expectations for a 1.1-million-barrel gain.The fall in petrol stocks suggested US consumption was stronger than expected, and may be healthy enough to support prices at a time when most fuel oil markets are very well stocked."US [petrol] draws are supporting prices today," said Tamas Varga, senior analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates. "They are an indication of stronger US demand."The EIA report also said that US commercial crude inventories rose by 13.8-million barrels to 508.6-million barrels.US bank Goldman Sachs said high fuel inventories and rising US crude production meant oil markets would be oversupplied for some time, but that they would drain gradually."We do not view the recent excess US builds as derailing our forecast for a gradual draw in inventories, with in fact the rest of the world already showing signs of tightness," the bank said in a note to clients."The draws that we expect will start from a high base," the bank said. "US production has also rebounded ... and we view the faster shale rebound as creating downside risk to our 2018 WTI price forecast of $55 a barrel, but not to our expectation that the global oil market will shift into deficit in [the first half of 2017]."High oil inventories have been undermining efforts by oil cartel Opec and other producers including Russia to tighten the market by cutting production. Opec and other big exporters have agreed to trim output by almost 1.8-million barrels a day during the first half of this year in order to prop up prices and rebalance the market.Reuters
