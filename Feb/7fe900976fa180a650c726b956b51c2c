Transport Minister Dipuo Peters has dismissed four Airports Company SA (Acsa) board members, capping a dramatic week in which the nonexecutive directors thought they had been granted a reprieve.McDonald Kenosi Moroka, Kate Matlou, Bajabulile Luthuli and Chwayita Mabude were served with notices of their immediate dismissal from the Acsa board in their inboxes just after midday on Thursday, when they were expecting to make representations at a shareholders&rsquo; meeting about why they should remain on the board.The minister&rsquo;s move has split insiders, with some saying the minister was trying to shield CEO Bongani Maseko, while others said Peters had signalled her intent to &ldquo;strengthen&rdquo; the board at Acsa&rsquo;s annual general meeting in 2016. It comes after several Acsa senior managers have been suspended for procurement irregularities.Subscribe to BusinessLIVE Premium to read the full story: &nbsp;Minister fires Acsa directors
