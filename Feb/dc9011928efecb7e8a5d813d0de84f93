Anglo American Platinum, the world&rsquo;s largest producer of the metal, swung out of a deep loss into profit in 2016 and forecast a reduction of net debt to below R5bn as capital poured in from asset sales and cash flows from all its mines, which are cash positive for the second year running.Amplats, which is 80% owned by Anglo American, has sold two of its large mines, Rustenburg and Union, and it expects to receive R1.25bn from asset sales during the course of this year, $100m from customer pre-payments, the cash from its mines, as well as reduced expenditure to contribute towards lowering net debt to below R5bn by the end of this year, said chief financial officer Ian Botha on Wednesday.Amplats had free cash flow in 2016 of R3.5bn. At the end of 2016, net debt had fallen to R7.3bn from R12.8bn the year before. Amplats has not declared a dividend since 2011 and will not do so until it is sure it can pay a sustainable return to shareholders, said Botha.Amplats swung to a profit of R696m for the year to end-December compared to a R12.4bn loss the previous year, in which it recorded hefty impairments.Amplats mined and purchased 2.38-million ounces of platinum during the year, a 2% increase as the company&rsquo;s own mines increased output by 5% to 956,000oz. Joint venture production climbed 2% to 785,000oz.Refined platinum production dropped 5% to 2.335-million ounces because of a problem at its Waterval smelter in September, which cost the company 65,000oz but which will be refined during the course of this year.Amplats reported a 2% fall in refined platinum sales to 2.416-million ounces as the company drew down on its inventories. After discovering errors in exchange rate conversions at its Unki mine in Zimbabwe and the valuation of metals in process and its inventory, Amplats had to restate financial data for 2015.The restated headline numbers for 2015 showed a loss of R126m from a R107m profit before and a headline loss of 48c compared to a 41c profit before. For 2016, Amplats said its headline earnings had increased to R1.9bn and its headline earnings per share was 713c.
