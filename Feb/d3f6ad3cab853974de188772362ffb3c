SA wrapped up the Davis Cup Europe/Africa Group II tie against Estonia 4-1 on Sunday in Irene&sbquo; Pretoria&sbquo; with Wayne Ferreira tipping young Lloyd Harris as a star in the making.Harris beat Mattias Siimar 7-5 6-3 on Sunday to finish the weekend unbeaten&sbquo; although SA No2 Nik Scholtz went down 6-7 (3) 3-6 against his counterpart&sbquo; Vladimir Ivanov.Ferreira&sbquo; a former world No6 in his day&sbquo; was brought in for the weekend as a consultant by SA skipper Marcos Ondruska."I&rsquo;m very impressed in the abilities of Lloyd Harris in particular&sbquo; he has a good future &sbquo;" Ferreira said &sbquo; adding the 19-year-old still had much to learn."He&rsquo;s still young&sbquo; plays like a young kid. But his fundamentals&sbquo; and shot-wise he&rsquo;s perfect. He&rsquo;s got a good base. He just needs to develop as a player&sbquo; right shot selections&sbquo; working on a couple of things here and there to improve&sbquo; but he definitely has a very bright future."Ondruska&sbquo; who played Davis Cup alongside Ferreira in the 1990s and early 2000s&sbquo; has previously said Harris is destined to make the top 20 in the world.US-based Ferreira said his work and family schedule would determine whether he would be available for the next tie in early April. Slovenia&sbquo; leading Monaco 2-1&sbquo; looked like the likely opponents&sbquo; which would mean a home tie for SA.He was heartened after informal talks with new Tennis SA CE Richard Glover. " Richard is a very positive man and he has some good ideas &hellip; and I think he&rsquo;ll probably do a good job. It&rsquo;s still early but I definitely have better feelings about it than I did say a couple of years ago."Ferreira said the federation had made a mistake by not previously tapping into former top players. "One year we had 11 guys ranked in the top 100 in the world in doubles &mdash; there&rsquo;s a lot of resources they could have used &hellip; I think Richard is very open to bringing those guys back in."A lot of countries do well because they hang onto their past players&sbquo; they get good use out of them."TMG Digital
