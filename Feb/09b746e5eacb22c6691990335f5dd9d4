Sasol warned shareholders on January 26 it expected to report on Monday its interim headline earnings per share (HEPS) declined by up to 44%. The chemicals group said it expected to report HEPS of between R8.26 to R10.68 from the matching period’s R24.28. The drop was partly due to a foreign exchange loss of R1.3bn for the six months to end-December from a R2.6bn gain in the matching period, Sasol said in its trading statement. A strike at its Secunda coal mine caused production to fall 16%, and the coal-to-oil plant the mine supplies had to buy coal, adding about R1bn to Sasol’s costs. Sasol’s share price fell 1% to R370.40 on Friday, taking its losses since it issued its trading statement to 14%. In contrast, aluminium products fabricator Hulamin said on January 23 that it expected to report on Monday that its HEPS for the year to end-December more than doubled. "A strong manufacturing performance in 2016 supported the delivery of record sales volumes," the company said in its trading update. Hulamin’s share price jumped 12% to R7 on the day it released its trading statement. After peeking at R7.20 on February 14, it fell back to close at R6.65 on Friday. Bidvest said in a trading statement on February 13 that it expected to report on Monday HEPS growth of about 5% for the six months to end-December. Its basic earnings per share (EPS) growth is expected to be between 37% and 42%, which boosted the share price rises of its associates Adcock Ingram and Comair.
