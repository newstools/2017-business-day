The rand eased on Friday morning, after reaching its best level in more than 18 months on Thursday. The rally in the local currency came as the dollar softened against a range of major currencies following this week’s release of the minutes of the US Federal Reserve’s most recent meeting.

"Market focus on the Fed minutes has mostly been around the fact that some members felt rates might need to be hiked ‘fairly soon’ but market pricing of hikes has not changed: 20%-25% for March, 70%-80% for June." The softer dollar has supported the gold price, which hit a three-month high of $1.253.41/oz.
