Former SABC executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng suffered yet another blow on Tuesday after the High Court in Cape Town dismissed the public broadcaster&rsquo;s appeal against the court&rsquo;s earlier ruling that declared he should not occupy any position at the broadcaster.Following a protracted case brought by the DA, the High Court in Cape Town ruled late in 2016 that Motsoeneng&rsquo;s appointment as group executive of corporate affairs, the post he held before and after becoming chief operating officer, was "irrational and unlawful".The SABC then launched an appeal. The SABC&rsquo;s lawyer, Stephan du Toit, argued in court last week that the ruling set a bad precedent as it fundamentally allowed outsiders "to interfere in the employment policies of organs of state". He said the matter needed to be clarified by the Supreme Court of Appeal.Motsoeneng&rsquo;s appointment "constituted an internal arrangement" and not an exercise of public power, Du Toit argued.The high court dismissed the SABC&rsquo;s application on Tuesday."It is high time that the SABC cease with its frivolous litigation at the expense of the South African taxpayer and focus on fixing the SABC and correcting the damage that Mr Motsoeneng caused during his reign of terror," DA federal executive chairman James Selfe said.Under Motsoeneng the SABC has lurched from one crisis to another and he is said to have been behind the collapse of successive boards.Meanwhile, the ANC Youth League has remained tight-lipped about its plans to lobby for Motsoeneng to be elected to the national executive committee of its mother body.There is growing speculation that Motsoeneng plans to enter politics on a full-time basis.Last week, Motsoeneng told ANC leaders at an event in the North West that he wanted to serve the country and add "value". He said he wanted to make sure "even white people have a place in SA"."I want to serve South Africans not political parties. I want to serve the people of SA."What comes to my mind is land.... What comes to my mind is education because we need to make sure after the university there is future for young people [be they] employed by SOEs [be they] employed by private sector even government," he said.Asked on Monday whether his comments meant that he was ready to assume a leadership role in the ANC, he said he would not discuss his plans with the media."I address crowds where I am invited if you want to know about my plans, come to the events that I address," Motsoeneng said.
