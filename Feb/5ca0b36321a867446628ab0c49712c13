The ANC in Tshwane wants to take back the capital city by ensuring that it "exploits" situations that would "accelerate the toppling" of the DA, forcing it to be placed under administration.This is according to a strategy and tactics document seen by Business Day that was allegedly presented at the ANC&rsquo;s regional lekgotla in Erasmia, Pretoria, two months after the August local government elections.It is not clear whether the ANC in Tshwane has adopted the stance suggested in the document.ANC Tshwane spokesman Teboho Joala claimed the document had been doctored and had "elements" not seen before.He said the party would one day retake control of Tshwane, but not through underhand tactics. "We&rsquo;re not hiding our objectives, but it will be done through proper, above board democratic processes."The new administration has had a torrid time since taking office, enduring land invasions and violent council disruptions.Read the document below:
