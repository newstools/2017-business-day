The South African bond market was slightly weaker on Monday morning as investors avoid taking positions before US President Donald Trump’s address to congress scheduled for Tuesday. The rand, which bonds usually track, was slightly weaker against the dollar but remained below the R13/4 level as its rally began to fade. Standard Bank analyst Warrick Butler said the local currency endured "a fairly comfortable" week last week despite the budget speech and foreigners were net buyers of bonds. In the US, investors were also in a wait-and-see stance, with US treasuries weaker ahead of Trump’s speech. At 9.01 the bid on the R186 was 8.75% from Friday’s 8.70% and that of the R207 was at 7.89% from 7.74%. US 10-year treasuries were bid at 7.8% from 7.74%
