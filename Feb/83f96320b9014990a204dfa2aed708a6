London &mdash; Oil slipped further below $56 a barrel on Wednesday as an industry report showing a large rise in US crude inventories signalled ample supply, even as Opec achieves record compliance with its supply-cut accord.US inventories rose by a larger than expected 9.9-million barrels last week, the American Petroleum Institute (API) trade group said on Tuesday, ahead of the Energy Information Administration&rsquo;s (EIA&rsquo;s) official supply report."Should this figure be confirmed by the EIA later today, US crude stocks will have risen to a fresh record high," said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM.Brent crude was down 34c at $55.63 by 9.49am GMT, half its level of mid-2014, when a global glut started a collapse in prices. US crude fell 39c to $52.81.To support prices, oil cartel Opec and other producers including Russia are cutting output by almost 1.8-million barrels a day in the first half of 2017. Although Opec has made a strong start in complying with the cuts, rising US stocks and a revival of US oil output have limited the price rise.Analysts expect US crude inventories to have risen by 3.5-million barrels, the sixth consecutive week of gains, in the EIA report scheduled to be released at 3.30pm GMT.Opec in January delivered record compliance of more than 90% with its output curbs, according to estimates from the IEA and figures collected by Opec&rsquo;s headquarters.Within Opec, adherence is mixed. Top exporter Saudi Arabia, keen to make the deal work, said it cut output by more than the amount called for by the agreement.BMI Research, in a report, said a compliance rate of just 40% by Iraq, Opec&rsquo;s second-biggest producer, "could prove problematic to group cohesion" as others would have to go beyond their targets to meet the overall goal.Russia and the other non-Opec producers have so far delivered smaller cutbacks. The oil minister of Oman, one of the participating non-Opec countries, said he expected Russia&rsquo;s compliance to be better in February and March. "Russia told us since the beginning [that] the cut will take some time," Mohammad bin Hamad al-Rumhy told reporters in Kuwait.Reuters
