As expected‚ Springbok coach Allister Coetzee will remain in his post after a laborious review of the 2016 season was finally concluded on Monday. SA Rugby’s executive council rubber-stamped the predictable outcome on Monday that also sees Cheetahs coach Franco Smith come on board as full-time backline coach. Coetzee still has three years to run on his contract, while Smith will stay on as Cheetahs coach for the next three seasons in a dual role with the Boks. There was no confirmation of Brendan Venter’s position as defence coach‚ as the former Bok centre is still involved with Italy’s Six Nations campaign. Former backline coach Mzwandile Stick has been axed from the Bok coaching staff to make way for Smith‚ but will be redeployed as Junior Springbok backline coach. Chean Roux‚ the former Varsity Cup-winning coach from Maties and Bok technical adviser under Heyneke Meyer‚ was confirmed as the new Junior Bok coach‚ replacing Dawie Theron, who resigned last year. Stick is the only member of the Bok coaching staff from 2016 to be sacked — SA Rugby will not call it that‚ saying he would "take up the role as Junior Bok backline coach", as if that was his preferred option. The Boks won just four of 12 Tests last year‚ yet the only casualty of the coaching shake-up is the man who had the least influence. The governing body wanted to make Stick assistant to Neil Powell in the national sevens team‚ but Stick wanted to remain in 15s. "Our coaching review was focused on the Springboks and we identified two areas to give Allister Coetzee additional support‚" said SA Rugby president Mark Alexander. "Franco Smith will continue the work he began with the backs and attack at the end of last year, while we are very excited about the new defensive coach we have identified to address matters raised during the review. "We expect to be able to confirm that appointment shortly." TMG Digital
