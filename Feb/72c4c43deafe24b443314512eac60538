Diversified industrial group Bidvest pulled off a 4.4% rise in first-half headline earnings per share (HEPS) to R5.10, supported by its underlying businesses. The company operates through seven divisions — services, freight, automotive, office and print, commercial products, financial services and electrical. Bidvest also owns significant stakes in JSE-listed entities, including Adcock Ingram, Comair and Cullinan Holdings. The company said on Monday that group trading profit was up 3.2% to R2.8bn in the six months to end-December as revenue rose 4.1% to R36bn. "Gross profit margin was stable. Portfolio mix benefits were achieved by replacing low-profit margin companies, with Brandcorp, which is a better margin business," the company said in a statement. "Bidvest Namibia’s margin continued to diminish as a result of increased fishing quota costs." Income from associates more than doubled to R200.9m, mainly due to significant improvements in the financial results of Adcock Ingram and Comair. The company said "expense control and asset management remain essential pillars of our high-performance philosophy and will continue to be closely monitored" in the next six months. The company declared an interim dividend of R2.27 per share, a decline of 52.9%.
