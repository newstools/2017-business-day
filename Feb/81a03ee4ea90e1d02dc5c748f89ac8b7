London — Britain’s four-time Olympic champion Mo Farah insisted on Sunday that he was "a clean athlete" after a leaked US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) report suggested that his coach had "almost certainly" broken anti-doping rules. "I am a clean athlete who has never broken the rules in regards to substances, methods or dosages and it is upsetting that some parts of the media, despite the clear facts, continue to try to associate me with allegations of drug misuse. "As I’ve said many times before, we all should do everything we can to have a clean sport and it is entirely right that anyone who breaks the rules should be punished," Farah said. The USADA confirmed on Saturday that it had compiled a dossier on coach Alberto Salazar following a report accusing the athletics guru of dangerously using drugs to boost the performance of his athletes. Britain’s Sunday Times said a USADA report — obtained by the Fancy Bears hacking group — had found Salazar abused prescription drugs and experimented with infusions of a research supplement based on the amino acid L-carnitine at his base in Oregon. The newspaper said it had seen documents showing that Salazar had given intravenous drip infusions to Farah and to half-a-dozen top US runners and that the agency had concluded the treatments of the Americans "almost certainly" broke anti-doping rules. USADA said on Saturday that no conclusion had been reached. "USADA can confirm that it has prepared a report in response to a subpoena from a state medical licensing body regarding care given by a physician to athletes associated with the Nike Oregon Project," it said. Farah, who won the 5,000m and 10,000m in the London and Rio games, said "if any anti-doping body has evidence of wrongdoing, they should publish it and take action". AFP
