London &mdash; Bob Diamond is looking like the last person standing at Atlas Mara, the troubled African banking group he co-founded three years ago.Atlas Mara&rsquo;s chairman left in December and its chief executive, John Vitalo, abruptly stepped down on Wednesday. On Thursday, the bank said it was cutting costs and had raised $13.5m through a share placement to invest more in financial technology and a markets and treasury business.In a show of support, Diamond bought a chunk of the new stock, raising his stake to 3.28% from 2.5%. He is acting chairman at the group while it looks for a replacement chairman and CEO.The company didn&rsquo;t say why Vitalo left and he didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to a request for comment. The former chairman, Arnold Ekpe, left last year to concentrate on other interests.Atlas Mara was Diamond&rsquo;s big project after resigning as CEO of Barclays in a 2012 scandal over alleged interest-rate rigging by bank traders.The company floated on the London Stock Exchange at $10 a share in December 2013, and in two shares offers raised $625m to buy banks in seven African countries.Diamond s co-founder in the company is Ashish Thakkar, a Dubai-based entrepreneur. They didn t foresee that commodity price falls would hit many African economies, pushing up bad loans at some of Atlas Mara s banks and causing its share price to fall. That stymied Atlas Mara s original plan to buy more banks by raising additional equity.The new shares were placed at $1.91 apiece and the stock traded at $2.12 Thursday.The group s latest acquisition, of Finance Bank Zambia in July, was paid for with cash from a loan to an Atlas Mara subsidiary by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the US government s development finance agency. Atlas Mara qualified for the loan because some of its biggest shareholders are based in the US, although it is registered in the British Virgin Islands.With a market capitalisation now of around $164m, some Atlas Mara shareholders have privately urged Diamond and the board to consider selling or breaking up the group, people familiar with the matter said.Private-equity firms have been approached about a potential transaction involving Atlas Mara, according to people familiar with those discussions, but nothing has been firmed up.The Wall Street Journal
