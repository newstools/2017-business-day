Estonia have more than Raven Klaasen and his fellow players to worry about in this weekend&rsquo;s Davis Cup tie against SA &mdash; they also have to deal with former singles ace Wayne Ferreira.Team captain Marcos Ondruska has drafted Ferreira&sbquo; who has more Davis Cup victories than any other South African&sbquo; into the Europe/Africa Group II clash as a consultant.Ondruska said he and Ferreira would take a look at Estonia at the event."We&rsquo;ll start picking apart some things that they do well&sbquo; and some things that they do less well," he said on Tuesday ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s draw.SA are ranked 58th in the world&sbquo; well ahead of Estonia on 79&sbquo; a place higher than Namibia.But Ondruska expects them to be a tougher proposition than SA&rsquo;s first opponents at the same Irene Country Club venue in Pretoria a year ago&sbquo; when they thumped Luxembourg 5-0.It was evident Estonia meant business, Ondruska said."You can kind of see it in their attitude and the way they were warming up and the things they&rsquo;re doing&hellip;."Ferreira met the team for the first time this week."It s a new experience for me " said Ferreira whose 41 Davis Cup wins in singles and doubles remains a record."I m interested to watch Lloyd Harris play I ve heard a lot about him."Harris 19 is SA s highest-ranked singles player at 288 while veteran Klaasen is the top-ranked player in the tie with a doubles rating of 13th.Klaasen said the Davis Cup brought out the best in players."You ve seen upsets in Davis Cup you don t generally see in other sports codes and I guarantee you this weekend there will be more."When you put on the green-and-gold you expect a little bit more of yourself because you re not just doing it for yourself."I ve always felt this [playing Davis Cup] was an opportunity to access people that have a knowledge base that I will want to tap into."Klaasen is the only South African player to have faced Estonia s top player Jurgen Zopp losing 3-6 4-6 in a singles match in Uzbekistan in 2011.Zopp ranked 317 said the hard court surface would suit his team more than clay at this stage.TMG Digital
