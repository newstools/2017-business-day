"Not for a second were we in control&sbquo;" is not the kind of thing winning captains tend to say&sbquo; but SA&rsquo;s four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the first one-day international in Hamilton on Sunday was not an ordinary kind of game.So AB de Villiers&rsquo; startling assertion was understandable.Minutes before&sbquo; De Villiers had to make sense of Tim Southee bowling off-spin at just a touch lower than his normal blistering pace.Southee&rsquo;s deliveries bounced like missiles and spat like snakes off a surface offering more turn than an electric screwdriver."I didn&rsquo;t see the ball turn that much when we bowled [in New Zealand&rsquo;s total of 207/7]&sbquo;" De Villiers said.That in a match reduced by rain to 34 overs aside."Early on with the new ball it wasn&rsquo;t so bad&sbquo; but it&rsquo;s easy to say that now. It would have sounded like an excuse if we&rsquo;d lost."Instead&sbquo; De Villiers watched as Andile Phehlukwayo heaved sixes off Trent Boult and Southee that had much to do with SA&rsquo;s scramble to success with a ball remaining.De Villiers and Phehlukwayo took byes to the wicketkeeper off the first two balls of a final over in which they needed two runs per ball. The second of those deliveries was converted into two wides after a ripper from Southee steepled high enough over De Villiers&rsquo; head to be ruled illegal.Control? Control is what happens when things go according to plan. Sunday was not one of those times."Experience-wise it was 10 out of 10 to be put under pressure like that with the bat&sbquo;" De Villiers said. "Conditions-wise? Nought out of 10."I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to face any conditions like that in the UK," he said.Which is where the Champions Trophy will be played in June&sbquo; when De Villiers hopes the preparation his team will gather in their five ODIs in New Zealand will be put to good use."The belief is definitely there [within the squad]&sbquo;" De Villiers said. "I won&rsquo;t look into it any deeper than that."We have great team spirit&sbquo; which makes it a lot easier on tour. But I won&rsquo;t analyse it too much," he said.Quinton de Kock &mdash; who hit nine fours and a six in his 69&sbquo; the top score in the match &mdash; and Hashim Amla put on 88 for SA&rsquo;s first wicket.But the rest of the top six&sbquo; De Villiers excepted&sbquo; struggled to come to terms with a slow&sbquo; sticky&sbquo; spinning surface.Chris Morris felt both sides of cricket&rsquo;s double-edged sword in New Zealand&rsquo;s innings.Morris trapped Tom Latham in front before dismissing both Doug Brownlie and Ross Taylor in one over and Neil Broom in his next.But Morris&rsquo;s figures&sbquo; which read 4/24 when he had Broom caught at square leg with the last ball of his fifth over&sbquo; ballooned to 4/62 when his last two overs bled 38 runs.Two sixes and three fours flew off the final over of the innings&sbquo; bowled by Morris&sbquo; that went for 25.The late blast was delivered by Colin de Grandhomme and Southee&sbquo; who shared 51 runs off 23 balls for the unbroken stand.That was the only partnership of 30 or more aside from a second-wicket effort of 50 by Brownlie and Kane Williamson.New Zealand&rsquo;s captain stood firm while Morris removed Brownlie&sbquo; Taylor and Broom for the addition on the scoreboard of only 13 runs&sbquo; and scored 59."That was a great win&sbquo; but there&rsquo;s lots of games left in the series and we know it&rsquo;s nowhere near done," said De Villiers. The next of them is in Christchurch on Wednesday.TMG Digital
