Defending Varsity Cup champions NWU-Pukke meet 2015 winners Shimlas on their home turf in Bloemfontein on Monday night in a fifth-round clash with a lot riding on the outcome for both camps.As things stand, Pukke and Shimmies are in the top three on the nine-team table with four rounds to go. The top four teams qualify for the end-of-season playoffs. Maties of Stellenbosch are top on 14 points, the same number as second-placed Shimmies but ahead on superior points differential, while Pukke of Potchefstroom are third, a point behind the top two.Pukke beat Ikeys of Cape Town 20-15 last Monday for their third victory from four outings, while Shimmies saw off winless basement-dweller CUT of the Free State 22-13.Pukke have lost just once this season, to Maties, while Shimmies were surprisingly beaten at home by a much-improved Ikeys outfit for their sole defeat.Pukke coach Jonathan Mokuena believes his charges can win away from home for the second time."We started our defence with a win at UJ and they have just ended Tuks&rsquo; unbeaten run and, while we did come off second-best down in Stellenbosch, I have every reason to believe we can get the job done against Shimlas&nbsp;For us it&rsquo;s about playing 80 minutes at a time and ensuring we follow our processes week by week."We&rsquo;re getting better by the week with the boys learning to play with each other and that is huge at the back-end of a competition that is getting stronger by the season."We must also be far more clinical in the score zone, we&rsquo;ve left points on the field when in the ascendancy and that we can ill-afford to do tonight."Shimmies coach Hendro Scholtz said: "That loss to UCT was a wakeup call at the right time. So no way will we give in to an opponent that enjoys the physical side of things."We must be on-song with our first-phase ball, then to man-up in the physical confrontations. Controlled aggression at the mauls is a must and stealing ball at the breakdowns will help our cause big time," he said.Shimmies wing Marco Mason has three tries and with UCT&rsquo;s Cuan Hofmeyr Hablutzel are the top try scores.Meanwhile, Ikeys and arch-rivals Maties meet at the Green Mile on Monday. The sides have met 12 times since 2008 with Maties winning eight and drawing one, but the former three-time champions have not won at UCT since 2013.
