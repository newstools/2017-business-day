Washington &mdash; US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s war with the media goes on as he becomes the first president in 36 years to dodge an annual roasting at the correspondents&rsquo; dinner.Here is a rundown of the past few days in the White House.The White House on Monday will send federal departments a budget proposal containing the defence spending increase Trump promised, financed partly by cuts at US State Department, Environmental Protection Agency and other nondefence programmes, according to two insider officials.Trump&rsquo;s first budget proposal will spare big social welfare programmes such as social security and Medicare from any cuts, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.The White House does not rule out that the attorney-general, Jeff Sessions, may recuse himself from Justice Department investigations into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Trump says he will on Tuesday give details to the US Congress on how he would like to overhaul former president Barack Obama&rsquo;s signature healthcare law.Trump&rsquo;s pick for naval secretary, Philip Bilden, withdraws from consideration, the second time a Trump nominee to lead one of the armed services bowed out because of government conflict-of-interest rules.Trump might support an investigation into last month&rsquo;s US raid in Yemen that killed several al-Qaeda militants but also left a Navy SEAL and several civilians dead, the White House says.The transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, says she is reviewing self-driving vehicle guidance issued by the Obama administration and urges tell a sceptical public about the benefits of automated vehicles.Trump&rsquo;s administration will begin rolling back Obama-era environmental regulations in an "aggressive way" as soon as this week, says the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.Trump says he will not attend the annual White House Correspondents&rsquo; Association dinner, a high-profile event that draws celebrities, politicians and journalists."I will not be attending the White House Correspondents&rsquo; Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening," Trump tweeted on Saturday.The last time a president missed the event was in 1981, when Ronald Reagan was recovering after being shot in an assassination attempt. Reagan phoned in with friendly remarks.Richard Nixon, who despised the media, skipped the event in 1972.Reuters
