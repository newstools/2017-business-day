The new management installed by Bidvest following its hostile takeover in 2014 "starts to reveal the positive impact and favourable direction that a cleansed Adcock Ingram is capable of delivering", the pharmaceutical group said in its interim results on Wednesday morning.Adcock Ingram raised its interim dividend 26% to 63c thanks to a 66% jump in aftertax profit to R286m.The group&rsquo;s revenue grew 11% to R3bn for the six months to end-December.During the reporting period, Adcock Ingram sold its Indian sales and marketing business for R328m, which was booked as a R49m accounting loss.The former Tiger Brands subsidiary reduced its stake in Ghanaian pharmaceutical company Ayrton from 78% to 25%, selling 53% for R11m, contributing an accounting profit of R1.3m.This means the new management has "effectively dealt with all other inherited underperforming assets", the company said.Adcock Ingram&rsquo;s most recent annual report listed Bidvest as its largest shareholder, with a 37.5% stake, followed by the Public Investment Corporation (PIC), with 22%, and empowerment partner Ad-Izinyosi, with 14.7%.In November 2015, Bidvest CEO Brian Joffe moved from the position of Adcock Ingram chairman to deputy chairman and promoted Andy Hall, the group&rsquo;s chief financial officer since 2007, to CEO.Adcock Ingram segments itself into four drug markets: prescription, which accounts for 35% of total sales and 34% of operating profit; over the counter (OTC), which contributes 31% of sales and 43% of profit; hospital, which contributes 23% of sales but only 8% of profit; and consumer, which contributes 12% of sales and 15% of profit.Increases in the government&rsquo;s single exit price (SEP) regime helped prescription drug turnover grow 13% to R1bn, the company said."OTC turnover improved by 16.2% over the prior comparative period, supported by increased volumes during the winter season and encouraging demand in the tender and export markets. Top brands including Allergex, Citro-Soda, Alcophyllex, Dilinct and Adco-Linctopent, all showed double-digit growth."Analgesic brands containing codeine, achieved very low growth following a change in regulation for these products. This business unit, which focuses on products in pain, coughs, colds and flu, and anti-histamine therapeutic areas through the pharmacy channel, posted growth well ahead of the market as measured by IMS [an information and technology service company] in the categories in which it competes," Hall said in his commentary.Adcock Ingram&rsquo;s consumer products division grew turnover only 2% to R334.8m"The division faced a challenging economic environment, where discretionary spend remains under pressure. According to Nielsen&rsquo;s, Panado, Compral and Bioplus continued to outgrow the product segments in which they compete," Hall said.Hospital turnover increased by 5.8% to R662.4m with all product categories achieving growth over the previous period."The group&rsquo;s enterprises in Zimbabwe and Kenya have for some time underperformed in challenging markets. These entities fortunately constitute a very small percentage of group assets and collectively incurred a trading loss of R900,000 during the period under review."The OTC division has taken responsibility for managing the Kenyan operation and we accordingly expect that the business will stabilise and hopefully improve its performance," Hall said.
