Wellington &mdash; SA have arrived in New Zealand full of confidence after replacing Australia at the top of the one-day cricket rankings but the Proteas will have mixed feelings about their return to Eden Park this week.The three-Test tour kicks off with a Twenty20 international on Friday at the Auckland venue where SA lost the 2015 World Cup semifinal to the hosts when Grant Elliott smashed a six off paceman Dale Steyn on the second-last ball.SA had been fancied to shed their reputation as World Cup &lsquo;chokers&rsquo; and reach a maiden final in the global showpiece and the defeat left several players in tears.It was later described by as shattered captain AB de Villiers&rsquo; "greatest disappointment".Test and T20 captain Faf du Plessis, who top-scored for his team in the semifinal with 82, said on Monday he still carried scars from the match."It was a great game, but it&rsquo;ll be mixed feelings getting back there," Du Plessis told local media in Auckland."Honestly, something like that you always carry it with you. As a team, we&rsquo;ve definitely put it behind us, but the emotions of the day will always be with us."That&rsquo;s not a bad thing. Although we were on the wrong side of winning the game, it was a great game of cricket and something that will always be with us."After the one-off T20 match, the teams play five ODI&rsquo;s before the opening match of the test series in Dunedin next month.The Proteas will look to stretch their golden summer into autumn, having swept both Australia and Sri Lanka 5-0 in one-day series at home.SA also beat Steve Smith&rsquo;s Australia 2-1 away in their test series and returned home to sweep the Sri Lankans 3-0 but face a New Zealand team unbeaten at home this summer across all formats.Du Plessis said the tour would be good preparation for the ICC Champions Trophy in England and Wales in June, a tournament the Proteas have underperformed in since winning the inaugural edition in 1998."We are putting a huge amount of emphasis on one-day cricket," added the 32-year-old."We haven&rsquo;t performed the way we&rsquo;d like in ICC tournaments."The buildup we have is looking good."New Zealand have a great energy in their team and they are very competitive, especially in the fielding department, so you always feel their presence."Reuters
