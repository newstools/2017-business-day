New Orlando Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret has barely had time to familiarise himself with his new surroundings and he is already sweating over March’s Soweto derby against Kaizer Chiefs. He signed a three-year contract on Monday to take over one of the hottest seats in South African football in the midst of a tumultuous period for the struggling Soweto side. The 54-year-old Swede replaced caretaker coach Augusto Palacios, who could not vacate the seat fast enough after a string of poor results. Pirates face Chiefs in a highly anticipated league match at FNB Stadium on March 4 and the coach said he would have to hit the ground running if he was to endear himself to the hard-to-please Bucs supporters. "I think we have to find our own way of playing and, hopefully, it is going to be successful and if not in the first week, we have to do it in the second week because I think it is Kaizer Chiefs in the second week," he said. "So, we do not have too much time." Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza said he had to fast-track Jonevret’s appointment. "[Jonevret] has staying power in the teams that he has coached [in Norway and Sweden] and I think that has been our challenge [keeping coaches for an extended period]." Jonevret said he did not want to talk about targets. "I think it would be stupid to talk about what is going to happen at the end of the season right now because when you are in a situation like this, you have to take [it] one day at a time," the Swede said.
