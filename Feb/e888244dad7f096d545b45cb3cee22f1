The National Empowerment Fund (NEF), which is to become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), is looking to its future parent company to inject R10bn into its operations over the next five years.The government announced this week that Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies and Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel had agreed to the NEF&rsquo;s incorporation by the IDC "to meet the considerable demand for funding by black entrepreneurs"."The merger will promote increased broad-based black economic empowerment with a specific focus on promoting black industrialists," a government statement said.In a briefing to Parliament&rsquo;s select committee on trade and international relations NEF CEO Philisiwe Mthethwa said the NEF needed an annual allocation of R2bn for the next five years and it would be looking to the IDC to provide this bridging finance.While its 2016-17 activities were fully funded, the NEF would need a cash injection of at least R500m to be able to implement its 2017-18 strategy, Mthethwa said. The NEF currently has R208m in uncommitted cash in hand.To date, the NEF has approved 839 transactions worth more than R8.5bn; of this, R5.6bn has been disbursed. In 2016-17 69 deals worth R927m were approved and R467m has been disbursed.Mthethwa noted that the current economic climate had raised levels of distress in the companies in which it had invested.The government said in its statement that the decision to incorporate the NEF under the IDC was "in line with government policy to consolidate SA&rsquo;s development finance institutions to provide effective support to emerging and existing black entrepreneurs, and thereby enhancing efficient service delivery."&copy; Business Day
