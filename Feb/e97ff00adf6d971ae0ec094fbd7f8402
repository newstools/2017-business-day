Four people previously associated with the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) have been short-listed for the agency&rsquo;s new board.These are the Nyda&rsquo;s current chairperson, Yershen Pillay, deputy chair Kenny Morolong, as well as former board member Zandile Majozi and founding member Sifiso Mtsweni.They all made it onto the final list of seven board members during Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting of Parliament&rsquo;s ad hoc committee charged with selecting a new board.The other three candidates who made the shortlist following two sets of interviews with the committee were mining specialist Joy Maimela, youth activist Ndumiso Mokako and community healthcare worker Bavelile Hlongwa.Ad hoc committee member for the ANC Kekulu Tseke nominated Pillay, saying his experience at the NYDA would help the board to hit the ground running.Another ANC ad hoc committee member Regina Lesoma nominated Majozi, saying she would bring continuity into the new board as well as "experience and awareness".ANC MP Zukiswa Ncitha nominated Morolong, saying his current role at the Nyda served as an asset.ANC member Bongani Mkongi nominated Mtsweni saying his role in helping establish NYDA after the Umsobomvu Youth Fund and the National Youth Commission meant he understood the mandate of the agency well.Ad hoc committee member for the DA Yusuf Cassim asked the committee to note the opposition party&rsquo;s objection to the process of selecting candidates, saying it lacked diversity in terms of geographic spread.The ad hoc committee will finalise now its report and recommendations for the new NYDA board. The report will then be handed to both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces, after which President Jacob Zuma is expected to sign off the recommendations.The ad hoc committee also recommended amendments to the NYDA Act aimed at clarifying criteria for appointment, especially related to age, experience and qualifications.
