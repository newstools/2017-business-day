Paris &mdash; Global art sales plunged in 2016 as the number of high-value works sold halved while China regained its status as the world&rsquo;s top market, Artprice said says in its annual report released on Monday.Art auctions worldwide totalled $12.5bn last year, down 22% from $16.1bn in 2015, it said.The world&rsquo;s biggest database for art prices and sales, working with Chinese partner Artron, attributed the drop to a plunge in the number of works worth more than $10m from 160 in 2015 to 80 last year."On all continents sellers are choosing a policy of wait-and-see," said Artprice CEO Thierry Ehrmann. Top-dollar auctions last year included that of an Impressionist painting of a haystack by Claude Monet, "Meule", which went for $81.4m and Peter Paul Rubens masterpiece "Lot and his Daughters" sold for $58.1m. both at Christie&rsquo;s.Contemporary art had its big moments with an untitled painting by American painter Jean-Michel Basquiat going to a Japanese collector for $57.3m and Wassily Kandinsky&rsquo;s "Rigid and Curved" of 1935 auctioned for $23.3m.China chalked up the highest sales total and "established itself clearly as the superpower" of the art world, the report said.After five years of dominance, China lost its title as top art market to the US in 2015, but a year later was back, recording $4.8bn in auction sales. That figure was 38% of total world sales, said Artprice, which compiled the data with partner firm Artron of China.Traditional calligraphy and painting made up the vast majority of sales in China. The country&rsquo;s biggest sale in 2016 was the scroll painting "Five Drunken Kings Return on Horses" by early 14th-century Chinese artist Ren Renfa, which went for $45.89m.Contemporary art sales were becoming frequent in Hong Kong which "has become an unmissable spot on the art market", Artprice said.Despite the drop in overall value of sales, the global art market enjoyed an 11% rise in fine-art transactions, a category that excludes antiques, furniture and applied art such as pottery."The range of prices under $50,000 shows the strongest progression and makes up 96% of the market in the West", the art database said."The principal objective [last year] was to consolidate the core of the market, to the detriment of a new race to reach record prices," it said.New York City remained undisputed capital for art auctions, chalking up $3.2bn in sales, over Beijing&rsquo;s $2.3bn and London&rsquo;s $2.1bon.Chinese artists were the main money makers in auctioneering, taking three of the five top spots for 2016 sales.Works by China&rsquo;s Zhang Daqian fetched the highest prices, followed by 20th-century master Pablo Picasso, then Chinese watercolourist Qi Baishi and "father" of Chinese contemporary art Wu Guanzhong, and, finally, German contemporary artist Gerhard Richter.AFP
