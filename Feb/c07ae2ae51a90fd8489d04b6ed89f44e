The rand was weaker against the dollar on Monday morning as political uncertainty around Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan increases. TreasuryOne’s director and head of dealing, Wichard Cilliers, said there were comments from various political players at the weekend, calling for the axing of the finance minister as they believed the budget did not contain enough detail about radical transformation. "There was also rumours that there was to be Cabinet reshuffle at the weekend, but this did not occur. We will need to wait to see what happens on the political front in SA," said Cilliers. US President Donald Trump will address the US congress on Tuesday. Cilliers said that the market would be waiting to find out what he said about his planned tax policies and what he was going to do about trade with the rest of the world. US GDP data is due for release on Tuesday while US nonfarm payrolls numbers will be released on Friday. Cilliers said the nonfarm payrolls data had caused quite a shake-up at the beginning of February because it sparked the current rally in emerging markets. He said traders would pay close attention to the data as they could fuel the emerging-market rally further or bring it to a halt. In terms of local data, manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) data for February will be released on Wednesday along with new vehicle sales numbers. At 9.11am the rand was at R12.9762 to the dollar from Thursday’s R12.9174. It was at R13.7128 to the euro from R13.6485 and at R16.1120 to the pound from R16.1295. The dollar was at $1.0568 to the euro from $1.0563.
