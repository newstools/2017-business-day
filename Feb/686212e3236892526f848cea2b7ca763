Imran Tahir should stick to cricket. Which&sbquo; as the No1-ranked bowler in one-day internationals and T20s&sbquo; he is doing better than most. Good&sbquo; because his rugby knowledge is hopeless. And that despite counting among his friends Sonny Bill Williams&sbquo; the All Black backline star who has become close to SA&rsquo;s cricketers&sbquo; particularly those with whom he shares the Muslim faith."We always pray for him that he keeps doing well for New Zealand&sbquo;" Tahir said in Auckland on Thursday.So far so fine.Then Tahir put both feet into touch and bowled an accidental wrong &rsquo;un all in the space of seven short words: " But next time SA might beat them."The Springboks&sbquo; who lost eight of the dozen Tests they played in 2016, beat the All Blacks who have won 13 of their 14 games?Bowl the other one&sbquo; Imran.The South Africans&sbquo; who arrived in New Zealand this week in preparation for a tour that starts with a T20 in Auckland on Friday&sbquo; had already hooked up with Williams."Every time we&rsquo;re here Sonny always comes to see us&sbquo;" Tahir said."He&rsquo;s a very kind man and we have a lot of respect for him. I wish I could have muscles like him but I&rsquo;m happy with what I am &mdash; I&rsquo;m not jealous of him."Tahir first met Williams two years ago&sbquo; and it did not take long for the All Black to make an impression on him."We were walking on a street in Auckland&sbquo; and I could see people&rsquo;s reaction. I was blown away&sbquo;" Tahir said."He stopped for everyone and took pictures."I&rsquo;ve never seen someone who&rsquo;s that famous."At 1.78m tall and slight&sbquo; Tahir is correct in that he does not make the same visual impact as the 1.94m&sbquo; 108kg Williams.Especially in New Zealand&sbquo; few people in any field are as famous as Williams.But there is no doubting that Williams cannot bowl as well as Tahir. In fact&sbquo; officially&sbquo; neither can anyone else."It [the No1 rankings] is very special&sbquo;" he said. "When I started playing cricket I never thought I&rsquo;d be the No1 bowler."It&rsquo;s all the hard work I&rsquo;ve done and I&rsquo;m very excited."There are a lot of good players in world cricket and coming out on top of that is a really good achievement. I&rsquo;m grateful."Grateful? To who?"It&rsquo;s an absolute honour playing for SA&sbquo;" Tahir said."The boys have helped me over the years and made me the bowler I am today."Those boys&sbquo; and millions of other South Africans&sbquo; will be happy that Tahir has stuck to cricket.TMG Digital
