PPC and AfriSam have revived talks to potentially merge their operations, nearly two years after the cement makers abandoned them.PPC said in a statement on Monday that both parties had concluded that current market circumstances warranted entering into formal discussions to consider the proposed merger.&ldquo;As part of such discussions, the parties will jointly assess the value that they believe can be realised for the shareholders of PPC and AfriSam if the proposed merger is implemented.&rdquo;PPC and AfriSam are searching for growth opportunities on the continent to offset a tough South African market, which is under pressure from low demand, oversupply and rising competition.AfriSam has a cement plant in Tanzania, while PPC has existing operations and plants in Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe.The proposed deal would &ldquo;create a South African-owned cement producer that is financially stronger, operationally more efficient and has deeper technical capability&rdquo;, PPC said.Robert Group&rsquo;s head of investments, Devin Shutte, said the sector had struggled with slowing revenues as economic growth and infrastructure spend in its key markets had been lacklustre.&ldquo;Both companies will hope to unlock synergies through the merger, and form an entity that can compete more effectively with other multinational and regional players,&rdquo; Shutte said.PPC stock price jumped as much as 10% to R7.71 on Monday morning, its best level since August.
