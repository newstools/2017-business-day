Hong Kong &mdash; Oil fell for a third day after industry data showed US crude stockpiles surged, raising speculation that rising supply from US shale producers is offsetting cuts by oil cartel Opec.Futures slid as much as 1.8% in New York after falling 3.1% the previous two sessions. Crude supplies rose by 14.2-million barrels last week, the American Petroleum Institute (API) was said to report on Tuesday. Government data on Wednesday is forecast to show stockpiles climbed for a fifth week. Oil output from the US will surge next year to the highest level since 1970, according to updated estimates from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).Oil has fluctuated above $50 a barrel since a deal to trim output between Opec and 11 other nations took effect on January 1. While Opec members implement pledged cuts and Russia says its own reductions are ahead of schedule, US production has edged higher as drillers targeting crude boosted the rig count to the most since October 2015."There&rsquo;s a recognition that even with the Opec production cuts, it&rsquo;s going to take some time for this large inventory overhang to be reduced to more normal levels," said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. "It leaves the oil price vulnerable to a move back below $50."West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery lost as much as 95c to $51.22 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange and traded at $51.62 at 1:30pm in Hong Kong.
