Lions coach Johan Ackermann said they did not want to be judged on how they started the Super Rugby tournament‚ but on how they peaked at the business end. While he picked a strong match-day 23 with eight Springboks for their opening round match with the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein on Saturday ‚ Ackermann said it was all about what they need to do this year. Lionel Mapoe has been shifted to right wing while Ruan Combrinck recovers from a shoulder injury. Howard Mnisi will fill in for him at outside centre while Ruan Dreyer will deputise for the incapacitated Julian Redelinghuys. "You have to stay in the moment and not many teams are able to go through Super Rugby‚ especially with this format‚" Ackermann said. "There have been examples of teams who started badly, yet went on to win the tournament. The Hurricanes were the example last year that shows you can turn it around if you win plenty of matches on the trot." Ackermann’s side was on the receiving end of a 55-17 shellacking in the Currie Cup semifinal in Bloemfontein in 2016. Cheetahs coach Franco Smith Franco Smith has 16 survivors from that game and the team will be captained by hooker Torsten van Jaarsveld. Injured captain Francois Venter is replaced by Nico Lee at outside centre. Clinton Swart fills in at No12. TMG Digital
