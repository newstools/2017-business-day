The Department of Labour has blocked its chief financial officer, Bheki Maduna, from returning to work even after he had been cleared of all charges at an independent disciplinary hearing.Maduna has been on suspension for more than a year on full pay and was found not guilty on charges of gross negligence, gross insubordination and misconduct levelled against him by the department. He claims the charges were spurious.The department was ordered to lift his suspension on January 13 and allow him to return to work in five days. He tried to return to work on January 18, but was barred from doing so.In the same month, the department was forced to return its labour registrar to his post after a two-year legal battle with Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant because of her alleged political interference in his duties. Maduna is facing similar resistance to being returned to his post, with the department set to take the outcome of the disciplinary process on review.On Tuesday, Maduna declined to discuss the details of the case against him. But he was adamant that the litany of allegations had to be "personally motivated" as none could be proven during the investigations and legal processes carried out over the past year.He may take legal action by approaching the Labour Court to compel the department to return him to his post.The labour department said it could not comment on internal employee matters.According to a written summary of the finding by the disciplinary inquiry conducted by the General Public Service Sector Bargaining Council, the first allegation against Maduna was related to his authorisation of a travel claim of R24,015 without exercising due diligence. The second allegation of gross negligence was related to the awarding of a contract and the irregular payment of R342,000 in the absence of an agreement. The third allegation was withdrawn, one of gross insubordination that was related to his defiance of an instruction by the acting director-general.The charge of misconduct involved his alleged failure to disclose assets as required by the Public Service Act.Forensic firm SizweNtsalubaGobodo was tasked with the investigation. The allegations were dismissed by the chairperson of the disciplinary hearing, mostly due to the lack of evidence against Maduna.
