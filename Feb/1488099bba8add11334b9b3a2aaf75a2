Berlin &mdash; Bayern Munich&rsquo;s Carlo Ancelotti could be in hot water with the German football association (DFB) after admitting showing the middle finger towards Hertha Berlin fans who he claimed spat at him."Yes, I made the gesture after being spat at," Bayern&rsquo;s coach told broadcaster ARD.Hertha fans were enraged after Bayern equalised with a Robert Lewandowski goal in the 96th-minute at Berlin&rsquo;s Olympic Stadium on Saturday to snatch &nbsp;a 1-1 draw which left the Bavarians eight points clear in the Bundesliga.The middle finger gesture happened as Ancelotti walked towards the players&rsquo; tunnel.According to magazine Kicker, the DFB is poised to investigate both Ancelotti and Hertha goalkeeper Rune Jarstein, who kicked a ball which struck Bayern&rsquo;s Xabi Alonso in disgust at the result.Hertha&rsquo;s coach Pal Dardai later branded the six minutes of added time "Bayern&rsquo;s bonus"."We always fight until the end. It wasn&rsquo;t my best goal and was my last ball contact of the game &mdash; you can&rsquo;t get later than that," said Lewandowski, who scored after 95 minutes and 59 seconds.AFP
