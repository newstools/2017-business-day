Rand strength and a retreat of international oil prices have combined to produce a surprise drop in fuel prices at the end of February.This is according to the Automobile Association (AA)&sbquo; which was commenting on unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund (CEF)."After a bit of a stutter at the beginning of February&sbquo; the rand has continued to firm against the US dollar throughout the month&sbquo;" the AA said. "At the same time&sbquo; international oil prices have come off their mid-month highs and are now testing their lowest levels yet for 2017.""Petrol is expected to drop by around 7c/l&sbquo; diesel by about 2c/l and illuminating paraffin by 8c/l&sbquo;" the AA said."If the rand&rsquo;s strengthening trend is prolonged and oil prices remain around their current levels&sbquo; it&rsquo;s possible that some of the recent fuel price increases may be reversed in the medium term."However&sbquo; the AA warned that the 39c increase in fuel taxes would apply from April 1. This is a combination of a 30c increase to the general fuel levy and a 9c increase to the Road Accident Fund (RAF) levy."It would take quite a substantial effort from both the rand and oil prices to offset the tax hikes and prevent higher fuel prices in April&sbquo;" the AA said.TMG Digital
