Group Five CEO Eric Vemer will leave the company "in the next few weeks", the construction group said on Wednesday, as it reported a loss for the six months to December and declared a much lower dividend. Group Five attributed the loss partly to costs associated with a deal reached with the government last year to fast-track transformation in the sector. The company cut the interim dividend to 14c per share from 42c in year earlier period. The headline loss per share in the review period was R3.10, from headline earnings per share (HEPS) of R1.31 a year ago. A total of seven major construction companies are to contribute about R1.25bn over a 12-year period to a fund to be used for socioeconomic development. Group Five’s contribution totals R255m. The company also noted that the commercial close-out and final settlement of "certain long-outstanding South African public sector contracts" had negatively affected operating profit. Group revenue was down 19.7% to R5.8bn as a result of decreased revenue from the engineering and construction cluster. The manufacturing cluster grew its revenue by 20.9% while the investments and concessions cluster’s revenue dropped 3.7% from the year-earlier period. The share price was up nearly 4% in early trade on the JSE, valuing the company at R2.7bn. Vemer would work with the board towards transitional arrangements that would result in the eventual identification of a suitable replacement candidate, Group Five said. Group Five also announced the departure of its engineering and construction division's executive director, Willie Zeelie, at the end of March. He will be replaced by the engineering and construction division's chief operating officer, Mark Humphreys.
