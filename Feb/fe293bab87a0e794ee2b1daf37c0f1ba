Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe is ethically compromised and should never become a Member of Parliament, Democratic Alliance (DA) chief whip John Steenhuisen said on Friday. He was commenting on the announcement by Parliament that Molefe had been included in the list of MPs from the North West and would be sworn in as an MP on a date to be arranged. His nomination follows speculation that President Jacob Zuma intends to appoint Molefe as minister of finance in place of Pravin Gordhan. For this to happen, Molefe has first to become an MP. "He is an ethically compromised Zupta buddy with corruption clouds hanging over his head," Steenhuisen said. "This nomination only confirms, for the umpteenth time, that the ANC does not care about fighting corruption. In fact, it seems you are more likely to rise in the ANC ranks if you are accused of corruption. "The simple fact is that Molefe is not fit to hold office in Parliament. "The DA has already laid criminal charges against Brian Molefe, who was found to be at the centre of State Capture in the Public Protector's "State of Capture" report. The report details the close relationship between Molefe, the Guptas and the Zuma family, and how they allegedly colluded at the expense of the people of South Africa. "This adds credence to the idea that Molefe has his eyes on the finance portfolio, and that a Cabinet reshuffle is imminent, just days before Pravin Gordhan is due to present the Budget. "As an incoming MP, Molefe must swear loyalty to the Constitution and commit to put the people of South Africa first, not Zuma, the Guptas, or his own pockets." BDlive
