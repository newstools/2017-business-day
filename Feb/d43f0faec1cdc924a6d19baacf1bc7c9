Berlin — Bayern Munich’s Carlo Ancelotti could be in hot water with the German football association (DFB) after admitting showing the middle finger towards Hertha Berlin fans who he claimed spat at him. "Yes, I made the gesture after being spat at," Bayern’s coach told broadcaster ARD. Hertha fans were enraged after Bayern equalised with a Robert Lewandowski goal in the 96th-minute at Berlin’s Olympic Stadium on Saturday to snatch  a 1-1 draw which left the Bavarians eight points clear in the Bundesliga. The middle finger gesture happened as Ancelotti walked towards the players’ tunnel. According to magazine Kicker, the DFB is poised to investigate both Ancelotti and Hertha goalkeeper Rune Jarstein, who kicked a ball which struck Bayern’s Xabi Alonso in disgust at the result. Hertha’s coach Pal Dardai later branded the six minutes of added time "Bayern’s bonus". "We always fight until the end. It wasn’t my best goal and was my last ball contact of the game — you can’t get later than that," said Lewandowski, who scored after 95 minutes and 59 seconds. AFP
