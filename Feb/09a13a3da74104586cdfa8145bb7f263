Legislation intended to improve the government&rsquo;s capacity to identify disease outbreaks and health emergencies is due to go before the Cabinet next week, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi told Parliament on Thursday as he closed a debate on the recent deaths of at least 100 state psychiatric patients.The patients died after they were transferred by the Gauteng health department from Life Esidimeni facilities to unlicensed, ill-equipped nongovernmental organisations in an apparent bid to save money.Motsoaledi was responding to criticism from DA health spokesman Wilmot James, who questioned why it was taking so long for the department to set up the National Public Health Institute of SA (Naphisa), which, he said, could have stopped the Esidimeni tragedy in its tracks.Naphisa is modelled on the US Centres for Disease Control and is intended to co-ordinate disease and injury surveillance and research. Enabling legislation is contained in the Naphisa Bill, which was published for comment in December 2015."Our country needs a responsible and alert health leadership across all spheres of government, resting on a real-time surveillance system."As soon as there is a death it must show up," James said.He said this required the establishment of Naphisa.The government had failed to recognise the danger facing the Esidimeni patients before it was too late, he said.Motsoaledi said the Naphisa Bill had been discussed by the Cabinet committee on Tuesday and was due to go to the Cabinet for approval next week.He said an inquest would be held for each of the psychiatric patients who had died. Authorities were also investigating whether the patients had been legally discharged or "stolen".Relatives of the patients issued a statement, appealing to politicians to consult them before taking action and urging lawyers to stop hounding relatives who had no need of their services.
