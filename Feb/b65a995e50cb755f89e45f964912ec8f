A challenging consumer environment, lower investment returns and a decline in earnings from Stanlib were the main drivers behind Liberty&rsquo;s 38.8% slide in normalised headline earnings for the year to end-December 2016.Normalised headline earnings of R2.5bn, represented a 37% drop in operating earnings on the previous comparable period and a 42% decline in earnings from the shareholder investment portfolio, which was hit by weak equity markets, Liberty said.Headline earnings from the group&rsquo;s South African retail operations of R1.1bn were 40% behind the year-earlier period.The high value of policy surrenders and maturities drove net customer cash inflows in that business 70% lower to R1.9bn. These were attributable to the challenging consumer environment, Liberty said.In its corporate business, earnings fell 13% to R191m. Net cash outflows of R751m (2015: R891m) reflected low single premium new business and high risk claims linked to the challenging economic environment and associated job losses, Liberty said.Asset manager Stanlib&rsquo;s headline earnings of R362m were 42% lower than the previous year."Continued low market returns and positive but lower external net cash inflows, higher once-off costs relating to the implementation of the outsourcing of its retail and institutional administration business and costs relating to provisioning for tax and client exposures contributed to this result," Liberty said.Stanlib s net customer cash inflows amounted to R5.8bn (2015: R8.5bn), due mainly to South African nonmoney market flows, while total assets under management increased 1% to R586bn.Across the group, net customer cash inflows amounted to R7.7bn (2015: R15.2bn), within which long-term insurance net customer cash inflows amounted to R1.1bn (2015: R5.4bn)."Management has taken active steps to address some of the shorter-term challenges and made a number of executive management changes to improve the execution of the group s strategy and to ensure that key initiatives are prioritised," Liberty said in its earnings statement."Management s immediate priorities are to address shorter-term challenges relating to sales, the ongoing competitiveness of Liberty s product suite and ongoing cost management," it said.Liberty declared a final dividend of 415c a share, 5% lower than the previous period.
