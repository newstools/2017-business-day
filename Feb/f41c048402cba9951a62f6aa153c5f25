Sasol cut its interim dividend by 16% to R4.80 from R5.70. Coupled to the government raising dividend withholding tax to 20% from 15%, this means Sasol shareholders will see the dividends they receive drop 21% to R3.84 from R4.85 per share. The chemical group’s turnover rose 0.5% to R85bn and its aftertax profit 13% to R9.4bn for the six months to end-December, Sasol said in its interim results statement released on Monday morning. Although basic earnings per share (EPS) grew 19% to R14.21, Sasol said its headline earning per share (HEPS) declined 38% to R15.12 due a stronger rand and a strike at the coal mine that supplies its Secunda synthetic fuel plant. At the start of the reporting period, Sasol promoted chief financial officer Bongani Nqwababa to joint CEO alongside Stephen Cornell. "Our Lake Charles Chemicals Project in the US is now 64% complete, and remains on track for start-up of the first units in the second half of 2018," Cornell said. "In Mozambique, we remain committed to our growth plans and will continue to partner with the country’s government and other stakeholders on projects that will help stimulate socioeconomic growth." Despite the strike, Sasol said its Secunda synfuels plant managed to increase its production volumes by 1% and its Eurasian operations increased production volumes by 5% due to stronger demand. Natref’s production volumes were down 7% mainly due to plant shutdowns during the period under review. Liquid fuels sales volumes decreased by 2% due to the Natref planned shutdowns and more volumes from Secunda being allocated to the higher-margin yielding chemical businesses. Sasol’s Oryx gas-to-liquids plant achieved an average utilisation rate of 95% with the run-rate of production in line with its previous market guidance. Sasol’s Canadian shale gas assets in Montney narrowed its operating loss to R312m from R333m, excluding a partial impairment of R7.4bn in the year-earlier period. For its full financial year to end-June, Sasol said it expected to sell about 61-million barrels of oil in southern Africa. Its capital expenditure budget is R66bn for 2017 and R60bn in 2018, the company said.
