The JSE opened weaker on Thursday in risk-off trade as banks, retailers and property stocks retreated on reports that President Jacob Zuma attacked the Treasury at the ANC’s lekgotla this week. According to a report in Business Day, sources said Zuma had criticised the Treasury for not availing funds for certain projects. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is embroiled in a court battle with Oakbay Investments, a company owned by Zuma’s friends the Gupta family. Gordhan is set to present the budget on February 22. Market sentiment was subdued after an indifferent close on the Dow on Wednesday. The index closed 0.14% up at 19,890.94 points, missing recent highs above 20,000 despite Apple climbing 6.1% and Facebook adding 2% on updates and results. The dollar weakened after the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold. The Fed gave little indication of further hikes this year, after earlier foreseeing at least three increases in 2017. "US markets could trade softer today as investors turned their attention towards macroeconomic data related to job cuts, initial jobless claims, nonfarm payrolls and, most importantly, unit labour costs," Momentum SP Reid said.
