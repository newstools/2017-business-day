The JSE opened flat on Monday as resources showed tentative signs of a recovery, following Friday’s sharp retraction. The resources 10 index closed 3% lower on Friday as weaker copper prices jolted sentiment. The copper price recovered more than 1% in late trade on Friday after losing 3% on Thursday. "The resources sector is now much oversold in the very short term, with technical upside likely to occur in the sessions ahead," analysts at Momentum SP Reid said. Gold was flat at $1.256.8 and platinum gained 0.16% to $1,028 an ounce. The Dow closed 0.05% up at 20.821.76 points on Friday. Asian markets were weaker on Monday morning with the Nikkei losing 0.91% and the Hang Seng shedding 0.76%. The market was awaiting US President Donald Trump’s address to congress on Tuesday, with more detail expected on tax reforms and infrastructure spending previously mooted by his administration. Barclays Research analysts said unless the US government refocused attention toward fiscal policies quickly, any tax and spending legislation was likely to be deferred until the 2018 budget. "The risk of delay in tax and spending policies is rising," Barclays said. The Dow was likely to be affected negatively if Trump did not divulge further detail on his plans. The Dow traded weaker for most of Friday, only managing to close positively on a late surge. Trade on the JSE was likely to remain subdued amid political tension between Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and the South African Revenue Service, and as the ratings agencies considered their decisions in the next few months, following last week’s budget in which personal taxes were raised to contain the budget deficit.
