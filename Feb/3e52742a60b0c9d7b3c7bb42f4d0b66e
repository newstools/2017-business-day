After a spate of news reports exposing the poor transport and cruel slaughtering conditions of donkeys‚ Gumtree SA has taken the decision to prohibit all advertisements for live donkeys and donkey hides on its site. The hides are being used to produce Chinese ejiao — which is falsely believed to have medicinal value. According to Gumtree spokesperson Claire Cobbledick‚ the company was made aware of the issue by both the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) and Ban Animal Trading‚ and decided to take action. "While there are many reputable farmers who trade in donkey hides and live animals‚ we decided that extreme measures would be necessary to prevent further unsavoury practices," she said. Gumtree initially suspended the sale of donkey hides after a Carte Blanche exposé aired on January 29‚ and has extended the ban further. According to a letter distributed by Ban Animal Trading‚ animal welfare organisations in SA regularly receive reports of donkeys slaughtered in rural areas for their skins. The NSPCA states that "donkeys are being rounded up stolen‚ then transported and brutally slaughtered for their skins, this can include bludgeoning them over the head and even skinning them alive. Even before the slaughtering‚ these donkeys are subjected to terrible living conditions, some being starved, as well as horrific transportation situations, including with no access to food or even water". Gumtree said it has significantly restricted the sale of animals on its platform over the past 12 months‚ including banning the sale of primates‚ sugar gliders‚ African grey parrots‚ teacup piglets‚ hedgehogs and dogs deemed vulnerable to use in dog fighting.
