If SA’s players feel like they have been shot in this movie before when they take to Seddon Park on Wednesday to play New Zealand in the fourth one-day international (ODI)‚ it is because they have been. The first match of the series was played there on February 19‚ with the fourth scheduled for Napier. But the Napier game was moved because of concerns over the outfield‚ which is to undergo rehabilitation. The fact that the visitors won the first ODI by four wickets with a ball remaining might make South Africans think their team‚ which leads the series 2-1‚ have the advantage as they bid to clinch the rubber on Wednesday. Closer to the truth is that the pitch for the first ODI spent longer than usual under the covers and, consequently, offered more movement off the seam than usual. And that played into the hands of SA’s pace attack‚ led by Chris Morris’s haul of 4/62. Rain has been forecast for Tuesday night in Hamilton‚ but Wednesday is expected to be dry. Unsurprisingly‚ the Kiwis are keeping a close eye on the weather and its likely influence on the conditions. "We don’t know what the surface is going to be like‚ but if it’s anything like last time, then batting’s going to be hard‚" Mitchell Santner told reporters. The uncertainty seemed to set Santner’s mind wandering in hopeful directions. "If it’s going to spin, we’ve got very good spin bowling options‚" he said. "It’s about not allowing ourselves to get flustered and trying to take the game as deep as possible." The game has indeed been taken deep in two of the matches‚ with the teams each winning one. In the other‚ in Wellington on Saturday‚ SA dismissed the home side for 112 to win by 159 runs on another seaming pitch. The fourth starts at 3am on Wednesday. TMG Digital
