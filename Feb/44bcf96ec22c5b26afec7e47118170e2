Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane will be getting "a legal opinion" this week on whether to oppose President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s review of her predecessor Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s State of Capture report.Mkhwebane on Monday denied reports that she was siding with Zuma&sbquo; who is opposing Madonsela&rsquo;s order that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng appoint the judge to chair to inquiry.In an interview with Sunday Times&sbquo; Mkhwebane said she believed that any judge&sbquo; even one appointed by Zuma&sbquo; would be capable of investigating the Gupta family&rsquo;s alleged influence on Zuma&rsquo;s Cabinet&sbquo; because the judiciary was independent.This was seen as a clear indication that Mkhwebane was likely to withdraw her notice to oppose Zuma&sbquo; the newspaper reported.But&sbquo; she told Radio 702 on Monday morning: "Now I indicated that we are giving&sbquo; we have given ourselves time to consult enough to prepare a well-informed affidavit whether to oppose or not to oppose&sbquo; that was based on the fact that the opposition was to comply to the court rules&sbquo; so purely based on that and nothing else."When pressed&sbquo; she said: "I have opposed to comply with court rules&sbquo; and I indicated that we have requested the legal opinion from senior counsel&sbquo; with the attorneys of record&sbquo; and then I will respond soon on where we are going."In fact&sbquo; if we didn&rsquo;t respond&sbquo; it would be to our disadvantage&sbquo; as an institution&sbquo; therefore we also needed to be given time to prepare our documentation and prepare our affidavit to indicate our intention to oppose&sbquo; and then we give enough information to say what are the reasons for us to that effect."Mkhwebane said she understood the frustrations of the public&sbquo; but said the legal opinion was expected this week.TMG Digital
