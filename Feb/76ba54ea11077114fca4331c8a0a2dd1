Tokyo &mdash; Nissan says Carlos Ghosn will step aside as CEO after leading the company for 16 years, allowing him to concentrate on using his cost-cutting expertise across its alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi.In handing over the reins to Hiroto Saikawa, a company veteran of 40 years, Ghosn ends years of speculation over relinquishing the top job at Japan&rsquo;s second-biggest car maker amid investor concerns that he was stretching himself too thin.Bringing Mitsubishi into the alliance in 2016 has put the group&rsquo;s annual combined sales at about 9.3-million vehicles &mdash; close in size to industry leaders Toyota and Volkswagen.That has brought new opportunities to benefit from scale but also the challenge of balancing the interests of all three car makers &mdash; particularly when plans to integrate Nissan and Renault further have been slow.Ghosn, 62, will continue to be chairman at Nissan, a position he also occupies at Renault and Mitsubishi. But he will remain CEO at Renault and be heavily involved in the company, an indication of the depth of problems he still sees at the French car maker. "There are still lots of things to be done inside the company in order to make its growth sustainable and lasting and solid," he said.While Ghosn did not elaborate on the issues he planned to tackle, deeper capital ties with Nissan have been stymied by the French government&rsquo;s lifting of its stake in Renault to about 20%.Known as "Le Cost Killer" from his earlier careers at Renault and Michelin, Ghosn burnished his reputation by engineering Nissan&rsquo;s comeback from years of losses and debt.He leaves in his place at Nissan a man cut from similar cloth, with Saikawa a veteran cost-cutter who has spent much of his career managing purchasing and supply chains.Reuters
