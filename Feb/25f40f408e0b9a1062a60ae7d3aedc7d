KwaZulu-Natal co-operative governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube is seeking the provincial government&rsquo;s approval to dissolve the Nquthu Local Municipality council and call for fresh elections.Nquthu is one of nine KwaZulu-Natal municipalities that emerged with a hung council after the 2016 local government elections.The IFP won 15 seats, the ANC 14, the National Freedom Party (NFP) two and the EFF and DA one each.The IFP, DA and EFF agreed to vote together. The ANC and the NFP &mdash; which was allowed to take part only in Nquthu local government elections &mdash; also agreed to form a coalition.At least six attempts at electing municipal officials such as mayor, deputy mayor, speaker and chief whip had failed after bickering, court challenges and intrigue among the various political parties.In October 2016, Dube-Ncube appointed administrators to take charge of Nquthu Local Municipality and Umzinyathi District Municipality, which had also failed to elect its leadership, and manage the day-to-day running of the municipalities."The MEC will approach provincial cabinet to recommend that the Nquthu Local Municipality council be dissolved and new elections be held," said Dube-Ncube&rsquo;s spokesman, Mthatheni Mabaso.Invoking the Local Government Municipal Structures Act 117 of 1998 allows the MEC to dissolve municipal councils, appoint administrators and facilitate by-elections.But opposition parties say this is a partisan bid by the MEC to aid the ANC, which she serves as provincial deputy secretary.On Wednesday Zwakele Mncwango, DA leader in KwaZulu-Natal, said: "This is a decision that was taken long time ago by the PEC [provincial executive committee] of the ANC. They wanted to take Umzinyathi District Municipality by hooks or crooks [sic] to prevent investigation of corruption in that municipality."They destabilised the seating of Nquthu municipality so that the MEC would come and do this," Mncwango said.The IFP&rsquo;s Mkhuleko Hlongwa Hlengwa said his party was not surprised. "This is not aimed at helping people of Nquthu to get better services but is aimed at ensuring that the ANC retains power," he said."She [the MEC] has aided and abetted efforts by the ANC councillors in Nquthu to disrupt council meetings called to elect the leadership."But we are not afraid of elections. It is just that this would have cost implications for which the MEC must be held accountable," Hlengwa said.The ANC said it would support Dube-Ncube&rsquo;s efforts at dissolving the Nquthu council and calling for fresh elections as this would end the six-month-long impasse.
