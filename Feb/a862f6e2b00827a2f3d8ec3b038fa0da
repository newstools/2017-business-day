Faf du Plessis has dispelled any talk of the ghosts of the 2015 World Cup semifinal swirling around the odd angles of Eden Park when New Zealand and SA play a T20 there on Friday, writes Telford Vice.Du Plessis took the direct approach when the question came&sbquo; inevitably&sbquo; at the first media conference of SA&rsquo;s tour in Auckland on Monday."There will be mixed feelings going back there&sbquo;" Du Plessis said. "Something like that&sbquo; you&rsquo;ll always carry it with you."As a team, we&rsquo;ve definitely put it behind us&sbquo; but the emotions of that day will always be with us. That&rsquo;s not a bad thing. Although we were on the wrong side of the result, it was a great day of cricket and something that will always be with us," the batsman added.The scorebook from that match says Du Plessis and AB de Villiers scored half-centuries in SA&rsquo;s decent total of 281/6 in the 43 overs their innings was reduced to by rain.But New Zealand won by four wickets when Grant Elliott&sbquo; who scored an unbeaten 84&sbquo; smashed the penultimate ball of the match over Dale Steyn&rsquo;s head for six.What the scorebook does not say is that SA&rsquo;s mental state was dealt a shuddering blow before the game by interference in team selection by Cricket SA.The suits demanded that another player of colour be picked for the cricket side.So Kyle Abbott&sbquo; SA&rsquo;s best bowler in the tournament&sbquo; made way and the integrity of Vernon Philander&sbquo; who had struggled with a hamstring injury for much of the competition and whose form had suffered as a consequence&sbquo; was sacrificed.Cricket SA at first denied their involvement, but admitted to it under mounting pressure in the media.The effects of the defeat and its circumstances rocked the national team&sbquo; who lost five of the eight Tests they played the next season.Now&sbquo; having won their last 11 one-day internationals at home&sbquo; SA are ready to take their show on the road."We&rsquo;ve got a nice thing going at home and it&rsquo;s important when you come to a place like New Zealand&sbquo; who have a quality one-day team and a really good record at home as well&sbquo; to have all the confidence and momentum on your side&sbquo;" Du Plessis said.SA are likely to need those factors&sbquo; and others&sbquo; to be in their favour against a Kiwi outfit who have won 26 of their last 30 ODIs at home.TMG Digital
