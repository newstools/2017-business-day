[sic]&rdquo;Motsoeneng was fingered in pushing through a plan to sell the government-owned SABC 24 hours news channel to the Guptas.Despite this he still has high ambitions to serve his country. I want to serve South Africans not political parties. I want to serve the people of South Africa. I want to add value. I want to make sure that people that are black have jobs he said. I want to make sure even white people they have a place in South Africa. Motsoeneng was suspended in December 2016 when the High Court ruled that his appointment was unlawful. The judgment stated the SABC board failed to uphold the Constitution and ignored findings by the Public Protector that he had lied about his qualifications and awarded himself irregular salary hikes. The SABC is understood to be appealing the court decision.- TMG Digital
