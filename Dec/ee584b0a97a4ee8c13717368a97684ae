Singapore — Oil prices inched higher on Thursday after a data report showed a decrease in US crude inventories, but rising petrol stocks and crude production weighed on the market. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $56.18 a barrel at 4.24am GMT, up 22c or 0.4% from their last settlement. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $61.49 a barrel, up 27c or 0.44%. Traders said the higher prices came as US crude oil inventories fell by 5.6-million barrels in the week to December 1, to 448.1-million barrels, putting stocks below seasonal levels in 2015 and 2016. The slightly higher prices also came after a big sell-off in late US trading. "WTI prices cratered (on Wednesday) despite a drop in weekly crude inventories…. Traders were more concerned about the steep rise in gasoline inventories," said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. Petrol stocks rose 6.8-million barrels, to 220.9-million barrels, according to the report from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), much more than analyst expectations in a Reuters poll for a gain of 1.7-million barrels. "This suggests that refiners may not need to process as much crude in the future," ANZ said in a note on Thursday. "The EIA report also showed that US production increased again," the bank said. US crude production climbed by 25,000 barrels a day to 9.71-million barrels a day, the highest since monthly figures showing the US produced more than 10-million barrels a day in the early 1970s. Soaring US output threatens to undermine efforts led by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and Russia to bring production and demand into balance following years of oversupply. Sukrit Vijayakar, managing director of energy consultancy Trifecta, warned there were "darker shadows over the pace of rebalancing, if at all any is taking place". Reuters
