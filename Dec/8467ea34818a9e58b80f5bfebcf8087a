Whoever emerges victorious in the ANC succession race next week may walk away with "a shell" of what the governing party used to be, South African Communist Party (SACP) general secretary Blade Nzimande warns. Nzimande was addressing delegates at the party’s 8th elective provincial congress in East London on Saturday. He was welcomed by hundreds of delegates who had gathered at the East London City Hall to elect new leadership in the Eastern Cape. Nzimande was axed as higher education minister during Present Jacob Zuma’s recent cabinet reshuffle. Nzimande joked that, as a parliamentary backbencher, he asked questions as if he were never in the Cabinet. "There is a need for meaningful and democratic consultation within the alliance," he said. "At times one person, normally a man, stands up and says, ‘I fire you’ as if he campaigned alone," said the SACP leader in a veiled reference to Zuma. "He then appoints a minister that causes problems and we as the alliance are asked to defend that nonsense," said Nzimande, who emphasised that "we are not after positions". "The leadership we would like to see emerging out of the ANC congress is the leadership that will roll back what is clearly a decline in votes for the ANC. "It must be a leadership that must be prepared to be inclusive and seek to actively destroy factionalism in the ANC. "Slates are not healthy for an organisation like the ANC. The danger is that whoever wins the conference may walk away with a shell and no organisation," Nzimande warned. "We were hoping the ANC is gong to address this factionalism and we hope it is not too late," he said.
