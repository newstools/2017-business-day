Disgraced political spin doctor Carl Niehaus "killed off" his mother in an elaborate hoax to wriggle out of paying a R4.3-million debt. Niehaus owed the money to a former landlord for the rental of two apartments in Sandton, damage to expensive furnishings and artwork, unpaid concierge charges and interest. In an audacious bid to avoid legal action, he claimed that his mother had died and he would soon receive a generous inheritance, 90% of which would allow him to settle the debt. His mother, Magrietha Niehaus, 88, is in fact alive and living in a home for the elderly in Johannesburg, other Niehaus family members said. Niehaus, who lately re-emerged from the shadows of financial scandal to become a vocal campaigner for ANC presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, has a history of lies and bad debt. He is also a proponent of Dlamini-Zuma's radical economic transformation policy, and yesterday he was on stage at a "victory rally" for her in Durban.
