Danisa Baloyi has been suspended from the Black Business Council (BBC) in connection with the missing R5m donation from Airports Company SA. Speaking at the BBC offices in Rosebank on Monday, BBC secretary-general George Sebulela said Baloyi, who was president of the organisation, had been suspended pending the finalisation of an investigation into the missing money. Baloyi was served with a letter of suspension on Thursday. “Key to the content of the letter is the council’s request for Dr Baloyi to refrain from any activity of the organisation in the name of the BBC until the matter had been resolved.” Kganki Matabane has been appointed BBC CEO with immediate effect. The BBC said it had been reliably informed that Acsa had formally laid charges against Baloyi. The BBC also laid charges against Baloyi last week. “Where is the money? I wish I knew. That’s part of the investigation,” said Sebulela. “There is evidence that indeed implicates the president. I must say, however, [Baloyi] is not guilty until proven guilty. But there is prima facie evidence,” he said. Last week, Sebulela said: “[Acsa] has confirmed that R5m was donated to sponsor the council. It was later discovered that the Acsa donation had not been deposited into the BBC’s bank account.”
