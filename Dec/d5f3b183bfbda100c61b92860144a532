BusinessLIVE has scooped the Best News Website award at the African Digital Media Awards hosted by the prestigious World Association of Newspapers. The association said in a statement: "BusinessLIVE is a major move by Tiso Blackstar to bring all its business media titles under one roof.  The site combines paid subscription, freemium, and free content and impressed the judges with its fully responsive design and rich media content. "As one judge put it; 'This is a beautifully designed website that is a pleasure to use on phone and on desktop'.” The judge added: "The fonts used and the overall UI works really well to create a low stress environment for the reader. The content is also compelling with well written news and features, engaging headlines. "The range of content is admirable and really engaging with diverse contributors." Head of digital at Tiso Blackstar, Lisa MacLeod said: "This is a fantastic achievement and is testament to incredible team work between product teams and editorial. BusinessLIVE is a site built on the principle of 'audience first'. "The success we are having with subscriber acquisition shows our readers love the site too." BusinessLIVE editor Ray Hartley said: "This award recognises the excellence of the TisoBlackstar development team and the wonderful web production team that powers up this site. "We are particularly proud of this because our content management system is a home-grown South African product that has been purpose built for our operation." The site is the home of Business Day, Financial Mail, Business Times and the Rand Daily Mail. It also carries top stories from the Financial Times and the top business wire services. The judges also said: "The site takes advantage of the company's dominance of financial/business journalism in South Africa by creating a one-stop business media "shop" for quality financial journalism, with politics, lifestyle, sports and other elements also in the mix." Netwerk24 was the runner-up.
