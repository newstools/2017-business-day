Investec’s share price rose as much as 4.1% to R88.49 on Monday morning after it reassured investors that its exposure to Steinhoff International was negligible. Investec has two shares trading on the JSE which are theoretically identical. Possibly thanks to the rand strengthening 0.35% against the pound to R18.28, Investec plc shares with code INP strengthened more than its limited shares with code INL, which rose 3.5% to R87.99. Investec said in a statement on Monday that its loans to Steinhoff represented less than 0.25% of its total R464.8bn credit exposure at September 30. Its loans to Steinhoff Africa Retail (Star) were less than 0.1%. "Based on the information currently available to the group, Investec is not expecting to suffer any losses on these credit exposures," Monday’s statement said. "The exposures are largely to Steinhoff Africa’s subsidiaries, with an immaterial exposure to Steinhoff. "The majority of the transactions have been undertaken by Investec Bank, with Investec plc having an insignificant exposure to Steinhoff. "The exposures to Steinhoff Africa largely comprise lending exposures and overnight facilities, and are secured by guarantees from certain of the Steinhoff Africa and Star subsidiaries." Investec said in the statement that it did also have "certain derivative exposures linked to the Steinhoff share price, where a trading loss could materialise", up to a maximum of about 3% of the group’s post-tax operating profit. Investec's total post-tax operating profit for the year ended March 31 2017 was R7.9bn. Investec’s announcement followed a call by the Financial Services Board on Friday for all financial institutions to supply details of their exposure to Steinhoff.
