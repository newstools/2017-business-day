Advtech has uncovered fraud by a financial manager in its schools division, and it will have to reduce the revenue and operating profit it reported in its past three financial years. "Criminal charges have been laid against the financial manager and the colluding external service provider. These charges are being vigorously pursued. The impact of this occurrence will be accounted for in the 2017 annual financial statements," Advtech said in a statement on Friday morning. The education and staffing group said the amount stolen is about R5m, of which R2m "should be recovered as the company has secured a court order freezing the service provider’s bank account, with whom the financial manager colluded".  "The balance should be recoverable through our insurers," Advtech said. The fraud involved R17m being added to the group’s revenue and R48m to its operating profit which will have to be restated. "Management deeply regrets this occurrence [that] … resulted mainly from head office book entries and will not impact delivery, fees or quality at any of our schools," CEO Roy Douglas said in the statement.  The fraud was uncovered as a result of changes being implemented through the restructuring of the finance and administrative functions in the schools division. "The amounts were not easily identified as they were not individually significant. Whilst not material, in the interest of transparency, the directors have decided to voluntarily disclose this to the market," Advtech said.
