The JSE all share opened flat on Thursday, despite platinum and gold shares jumping on the news that Sibanye-Stillwater had announced an intended takeover of Lonmin. Gold shares were also boosted by a weaker dollar, but Naspers opened weaker. Sibanye-Stillwater said the agreement with Lonmin entailed an all-share offer, and it "expected the transaction to be net asset value accretive". At 9.35am Sibanye-Stillwater was down 1.43% at R15.88, but Lonmin rocketed 17.6% to R14.70. Steinhoff shares came under renewed pressure after the group announced that its 2016 financial statements would also need to be restated and could no longer be relied on. This raised new concerns about the extent of financial problems at the global retailer, which led to the share plummeting 90%. Earlier, auditors refused to clear Steinhoff’s 2017 financial results due to accounting irregularities. At 9.35am Steinhoff was down 10.2% to R8.80. Early market sentiment was subdued, following the expected decision by the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates by 25 basis points. The main concern for monetary policy was the medium-term outlook, which was clouded by concern over a financial market shock, uncertainty over the implication of the new tax bill, and stubbornly low inflation, while the labour market was at full employment, Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking analysts said. "The Fed still saw three rate hikes next year, but stressed that this may be revised if needed," Nedbank said. The Dow closed 0.33% up at a new record 24,585.43 points, but Asian markets trended weaker on Thursday after the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) raised interest rates on its medium-term lending facility. The Nikkei 225 lost 0.28% and the Hang Seng 0.18%. At 9.35am the all share was exactly flat at 57,342 points and the blue-chip top 40 softened 0.06%. The gold index rose 2.49%, platinums 2.05%, resources 0.41%, and food and drug retailers 0.36%. Industrials shed 0.28%. PSG was down 0.25% to R237.88, but Brait rebounded 3.91% to R39.86. Cement producer PPC lost 7.28% to R5.86. LafargeHolcim announced on Wednesday night it had terminated talks with PPC. Telkom dropped 1.21% to R45.90. Naspers was down 0.76% to R3,452.99.
