The rand was slightly firmer on Friday morning, as local political tension took a backseat to developments in the US. Plans to pass the US tax reform plan hit a snag in Congress, causing the dollar to weaken. Senate Republicans battled in their efforts to overhaul the tax code, forcing them to contemplate rethinking their plan to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, Dow Jones Newswires reported. New analysis has shown that the plan would result in the budget deficit increasing by another $1-trillion over the next decade. That led to a rethink among Republicans ahead of a final vote on the plan. The Senate will now convene on Friday to continue the debate on taxes. "Although Republicans are optimistic, party leaders still do not have firm commitments from enough senators to ensure the bill would pass," FxPro analysts said. Locally, it was reported that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosaâ€™s support as the next ANC president rose to 43% in November from 36% in August, according to a poll by Kantar Public released on Friday morning. Ramaphosa is regarded as a pro-business candidate. At 9.01am the rand was at R13.6841 to the dollar from R13.7092, at R16.3133 to the euro from R16.3183 and at R18.5074 to the pound form R18.5451. The euro was at $1.192 from $1.1904.
