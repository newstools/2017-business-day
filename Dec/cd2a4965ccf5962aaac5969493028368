The Department of Health has issued a warning on an outbreak of food-borne disease Listeriosis.  At least 36 people have died in the past 11 months and 557 cases had been detected this year alone, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said on Tuesday. That is as much as 10 times the usual annual rate of 60-80 cases recorded. "Most cases (62%, or 345 cases) have been reported from Gauteng‚" Motsoaledi said.  The Western Cape had reported 71 cases, followed by KwaZulu-Natal with 37 cases.  "As you can see the three provinces alone are responsible for 82% of the total cases. The remaining 18% is distributed in the remaining six provinces‚" Motsoaledi said.  He explained that the disease was "a serious‚ but treatable and preventable disease caused by the bacterium‚ Listeria monocytogenes".  People with the disease usually suffer from a flu-like illness‚ diarrhoea accompanied by a fever‚ general body pains‚ vomiting and weakness.  This can lead to septicaemia and meningoencephalitis‚ which is an infection of the brain.  "The bacteria is widely distributed in nature and can be found in soil‚ water and vegetation. Animal products and fresh produce such as fruits and vegetables can be contaminated from these sources‚" Motsoaledi said.  While anyone could contract the disease‚ those who could most easily contract it are newborns‚ the elderly‚ pregnant women‚ and people with weak immunity‚ such as those with HIV‚ diabetes‚ cancer‚ and chronic liver or kidney disease.
