The Christmas festive season often brings more than good cheer and brandy butter for many people, when spending gets out of hand, leading to debt, which is a major stress factor and one of the biggest healthcare risks to SA’s workforce. Workforce Healthcare MD Richard Malkin spoke to Business Day TV’s Leigh Roberts about the effect debt can have on your well-being. Debt leads to stress, which has a physical effect on the body, including increasing the levels of cortisol. This can lead to more serious conditions, such as anxiety and depression. Workforce Healthcare has a 24-hour call centre for employees who are struggling with stress and other problems.
