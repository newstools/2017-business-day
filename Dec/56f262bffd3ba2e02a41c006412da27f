Credentials will make or break the ANC conference and are expected to be a contentious issue, Northern Cape chairman Zamani Saul said on Sunday. He said credentials had to be adopted in order for the conference to officially start. The ANC cannot move on to the nomination and voting of leadership until this is done. “Credentials are always a contentious matter and it’s make or break [for the] conference, so obviously there will be contentious views and contestation from different sides but at the end of the day we must adopt them,” Saul said. The conference was delayed on Saturday so the national executive committee (NEC) could deal with court judgments that had nullified certain delegates and two provincial executive committees (PECs) from voting at the conference. Credentials, which were meant to take place on day one, were expected to get under way at 9am on Sunday. Saul’s province, the Northern Cape, has endorsed Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to take over as president of the ANC. He said he was confident in the numbers and in Ramaphosa’s chances. “We are optimistic that by the end of the conference Cyril will be the president of the country,” he said. On the other side of the spectrum, NEC member Lindiwe Zulu made it clear on Sunday that she was backing Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma while speaking to journalists on the sidelines of the conference. “This is a historical moment for us as women,” Zulu said. She said that Dlamini-Zuma should win, both for the historical liberation movement and for the emancipation of women.
