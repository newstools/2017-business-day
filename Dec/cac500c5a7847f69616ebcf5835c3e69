The rand was back under R12.50 to the dollar on Wednesday morning, strengthening more than 2% over Christmas on reports the new ANC national executive committee (NEC) wants President Jacob Zuma’s resignation. City Press reported on Christmas Eve that ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa and secretary-general Ace Magashule would lead discussions with Zuma to persuade him to voluntarily step down. "It was said that he should be requested [to step down] outside of the formalities of the NEC processes, to avoid making it appear as if the NEC removed him. If he does not co-operate, a resolution of the NEC can be easily secured. We all agree that the sooner he goes, the better," an anonymous ANC leader told City Press. The rand strengthened 2.2% from R12.77 to the dollar on Friday to R12.49 to the dollar at 6.30am on Wednesday. It strengthened from R15 to the euro to R14.82 to the euro, and from R16.89 to the pound to R16.71 to the pound.
