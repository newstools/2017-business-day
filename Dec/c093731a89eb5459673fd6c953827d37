Ace Magashule will remain the elected secretary-general of the ANC after a day of drama over 68 missing ballots. Business Day understands that 17 ballots were found to be in his opponent, Senzo Mchunu’s, favour and added to the tally, but this was not enough for him to beat Magashule to the post. There has been no official communication from the ANC on this amid massive speculation about what is happening. The matter is now likely to be shut down at plenary, where delegates are expected to debate the matter. Depending what happens at plenary, however, the issue could land up in court. Business Day understands that court documents have already been prepared. The ANC steering committee met for most of Tuesday to try to resolve the matter. Supporters of newly elected ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa and his ally, Senzo Mchunu, raised concern that Magashule’s election was irregular. Magashule and Mchunu were both vying for the position of secretary-general, which the former clinched on Monday by a mere 24 votes. The 68 ballots are said to be from Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal, and are said to have gone missing during the election of the party’s top six leaders. The bulk of the missing votes came from delegates said to be from Mchunu-allied branches, increasing speculation that these votes could easily overturn the narrow difference that separated Mchunu and Magashule.
