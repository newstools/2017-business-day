President Jacob Zuma wanted Brian Molefe as finance minister instead of Pravin Gordhan‚ ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte has confirmed. In an unprecedented move, Zuma has been ordered to personally pay costs for an application he brought to interdict the release and finalisation of the public protector’s State of Capture report. There’s a myth about Afrikaner capitalism; that it represents a uniquely productive form of wealth creation because it recognises the power of ethnic bonds. People say the same thing about Jewish businesses here, writes Peter Bruce. The ANC’s method of choosing leaders shows how absurd it is to allow people who represent others to vote in secret. There is nothing fair or democratic about this, writes Steven Friedman. Before the fall, Steinhoff was the seventh-largest top 40 JSE stock, accounting for about 2.5% of the index (now about 0.3%). The crash has eroded the savings of millions of South Africans. And, coming at the same time as the fall in Naspers shares, it could do significant damage to SA’s financial sector in a short space of time. Naspers was taking measures to reduce its stock’s significant discount to fair value, largely the result of capital outflows from SA, CEO Bob van Dijk told investors in New York on Tuesday. US President Donald Trump’s magnanimous tweet to the Democrat victor in the Alabama senatorial election got a lot of incredulous responses.
