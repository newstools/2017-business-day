Aldemore shareholders in London voted overwhelmingly to approve the FirstRand’s offer to acquire Aldermore. Some 99.97% of the votes cast were in favour of the offer. Johan Burger, Chief Executive Officer of FirstRand Ltd said: "I am very pleased that we have reached this important milestone in our offer for Aldermore. This transaction is one part of our strategy of diversifying revenues to create long term, sustainable shareholder value. The management team at Aldermore have built a very successful bank and it will be a valuable addition to our multi-branded portfolio of leading financial services franchises." Completion of the offer is, among other requirements, subject to approval by the regulatory authorities in both the United Kingdom and South Africa. Finalisation is expected in the first quarter of 2018. Aldermore, a little-known British retail and business bank, became something of a household name among local investors after it emerged that SA’s largest bank by market value, FirstRand, was keen to drop R19.4bn to buy it. It was a landscape-altering proposal. If the deal goes through as expected, FirstRand will join a growing list of SA companies — Famous Brands, The Foschini Group and Truworths — that have deployed capital in foreign markets as SA’s growth stagnates. Last year, Rand Merchant Investment bought UK short-term insurer Hastings for R8bn — a stake now worth R9.9bn. But it’s about more than weak growth: in FirstRand’s case (as with Discovery and Sanlam), the company has simply outgrown an economy that contributes less than 1% to global GDP. Were it to mount a similar-sized takeover at home, the competition commission would block it. If the deal gets the green light, it will boost FirstRand exposure to the UK from 5% to 12%. Luckily for FirstRand, it seems Aldermore — a challenger bank comparable with Virgin Money and OneSavings Bank — will be a good fit for a group that prides itself on innovation. This is probably why FirstRand has described Aldermore as "the ideal platform" from which to fulfil its UK expansion strategy on an "accelerated basis". With Hanna Ziady
