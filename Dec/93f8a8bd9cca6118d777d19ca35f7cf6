South African bonds were steady on Friday morning, tracking a stable rand. The rand has stabilised following a relatively volatile week, with the local currency weakening to R14.13 on Monday as the market tried to make sense of the downgrade by S&P Global Ratings. The rand has since recovered 3.18% against the dollar. Political risk, however, lingers in the build-up to the ANC’s elective conference. Sasfin fixed income traders said the political risk continued to dent short-term investor confidence, with bonds registering further declines even as the rand remained below R13.80/$. At 8.49am the bid on the R186 government bond was unchanged from Thursday’s 9.350%, while the R207 was bid at 8.105% from 8.110%. The rand was at R13.6862 from R13.7092. US 10-year treasuries were slightly weaker, under pressure as Republicans battle to pass their tax reform plan. The vote by the Senate on the tax bill did not take place on Thursday, with the debate expected to continue on Friday. Republican senator John McCain added his support to the tax overhaul bill, saying it would boost the economy.
