The JSE all share index opened firmer on Monday, as Naspers rebounded on a stronger Hong Kong market and retailers digested Steinhoff Africa’s annual results. Miners led at the opening after oil prices rallied on Friday on an agreement between oil cartel Opec and other big producers to extend production cuts into 2018. Naspers rose following a negative close last week as Chinese internet company Tencent firmed 2% on the Hang Seng. Naspers owns 34.4% of Tencent. Investors shrugged off allegations that Naspers subsidiary MultiChoice was involved in bribery and had paid the Gupta-aligned ANN7 TV-channel millions over the past few years. MultiChoice said it would investigate the allegations, while Naspers chairman Koos Bekker said in an interview that there were no immediate plans to remove ANN7 from MultiChoice’s DStv channels. Naspers lost 6.1% last week. Naspers usually follows the trade in Tencent, but MultiChoice remains an important cash cow for the group, as revealed by last week’s interim results. The rand was steady around R13.76/$ on the news that Mpumalanga premier David Mabuza may hold the key to the outcome of the ANC elective conference later this month. Mabuza is leading a "unity slate" to force the two frontrunners — Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and ANC MP Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma — to heal divisions expected at the conference. The Dow closed 0.17% lower at 24,231.59 points on Friday in choppy trade as market sentiment was weighed down by news that former national security adviser Michael Flynn had lied about meeting the Russian ambassador. The news that a reformed tax bill was passed by the US Senate came after the market closed, and may support the Dow at the opening on Monday. The Senate and the House of Representatives needed to reconcile their respective bills for the tax reform to take place, said TreasuryOne trade Andre Botha. "But the percentage odds of a conclusion in this matter is in the mid-60s now after being only 7% a month ago," he said. The Nikkei 225 was down 0.49% and the Hang Seng gained 0.6%.
