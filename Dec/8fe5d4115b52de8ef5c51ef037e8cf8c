After stern resistance to the nonbinding vote on remuneration policy at a recent annual general meeting, Remgro’s engagement on Thursday with dissenting shareholders on the matter lasted only 20 minutes. It was a courteous affair with indications that shareholders had mostly corresponded with Remgro on the remuneration matter before the meeting. The engagement was called by Remgro after nearly 40% of shareholders voted against the nonbinding policy on remuneration and the implementation of this policy. The most prickly issue was Remgro chairman and de facto controlling shareholder Johann Rupert serving as the chairman of the remuneration committee. Dugan Fraser, a director at the Raith Foundation, urged a separation in the roles of chairman of the board and chairman of the committee. Remgro CEO Jannie Durand said the board was supportive of Rupert chairing the committee as he was a large shareholder who drew no salary and was not involved in the executive incentive scheme. Durand also reiterated the difficulty in setting up long-term performance hurdles in executive incentive schemes when a company operated as a diversified investment company. He said a number of gauges had been suggested by shareholders, ranging from inflation-and GDP-linked benchmarks, return on equity as well as dividend yield and earnings targets. "We will consider them all and evaluate which will be the most applicable to our remuneration scheme," said Durand. Brian Kantor, investment strategist at Investec, argued that an investment holding company existed to make money through investments in other firms. "The [management’s] value-add is the rationale for remuneration … if you can improve the net value or improve the [share price] discount to the sum of the parts, then that should be the basis of performance recognition," he said. hasenfussm@fm.co.za
