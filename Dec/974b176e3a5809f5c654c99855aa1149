Former communications minister Yunus Carrim opens up on a meeting with Koos Bekker, saying the Naspers chairperson’s "main purpose was to persuade me about the folly of set-top box encryption, and seemed irritated that I would not agree with him". The SACP is willing to consider getting into a coalition with the ANC but not the DA. What was the point of contesting against the ruling party, then? Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has to find ways of plugging the R50bn budget shortfall. Yet, notably absent from his thinking is freezing or cutting the public-sector wage bill, which is probably the most important element required to rebalance public finances. The last thing Naspers and SA need is for the group to join McKinsey, SAP, KPMG and Bell Pottinger in disrepute. Meanwhile, Naspers concedes that finding another Tencent is unlikely but is excited about companies that use technology in education. What a long way to go before African Bank catches up with Capitec. But the bank is now solvent and growing. Following Bell Pottinger’s demise, the Guptas have outsourced propaganda manufacturing to a dodgy sweatshop that can’t even pronounce apartheid correctly.
