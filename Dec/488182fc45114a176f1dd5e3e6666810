Perth — Victorious Australia will head to Melbourne for the Boxing Day Test against England brimming with confidence after reclaiming the Ashes in Perth and on a mission to subject the tourists to another 5-0 series whitewash. Captain Steve Smith was a member of the Michael Clarke side that swept the last series Down Under in 2013-14 and will feel good about his chances of emulating his former skipper by defeating Joe Root’s demoralised team in the final two matches. "It’d be fantastic to do that and we’ll talk about Melbourne when we get there," Smith said. "Right now, I’m really satisfied with what we’ve achieved in these first three Test matches. I’d love to do that again." Australia were able to pick the same team throughout the 2013-14 series, but Smith may not have that luxury due to Mitchell Starc’s injury. The pace spearhead carried a heel injury through the final day at the Waca and could be rested for Melbourne, which may open the door to a recall for squad seamer Jackson Bird. With Josh Hazlewood in top form after grabbing five wickets to rout England for 218 at the Waca, Australia are unlikely to be overly concerned about Starc’s possible absence. Coach Darren Lehmann said he was eager to see how the team would play with the pressure of winning the series on home soil behind them. "It’s highly pressured, Ashes cricket," he said. "They can go and express themselves a little bit more now, so we’ll be playing the same brand of cricket but with less pressure on us." Since an acrimonious series defeat at home to SA a year ago, Australia have won nine of their past 13 Tests, with their captain leading the way with more than 1,000 runs in the calendar year. Smith’s 239 at the Waca, following an unbeaten 141 at the Gabba, has given him an astonishing average of 142 for the Ashes series. Long saddled with the burden of scoring in a vulnerable batting line-up, Smith has now been enjoying ample support. Reuters
