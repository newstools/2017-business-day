The Department of Trade and Industry and the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) plan to launch an investigation into allegations of Steinhoff’s noncompliance with the Companies Act and its regulations. In a statement on Tuesday, the department said it and the CIPC had noted with "great concern" allegations of governance failures and financial irregularities at the retailer, which led to the resignation of its CEO Markus Jooste. "The Department of Trade and Industry will further suggest that the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (Irba) also consider the circumstance with regard to the role of auditors in this instance," the department said in the statement. The probe into Steinhoff is mainly concentrated in Germany, where the company has a dual listing. However, the Financial Services Board (FSB) has requested that all financial services providers supply it with details of their exposure to Steinhoff International. The FSB’s move appears to have been prompted by concern expressed by the finance minister last week. Steinhoff itself set up a board subcommittee to engage with its banks. But this failed to impress critics who said the board should have foreseen the crisis before it happened. On Monday, the chairperson of Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa), Themba Godi, called on the Treasury to be more "strident in its condemnation of the Steinhoff scandal than it has been", and called for investigations by the South African Revenue Service (SARS)‚ the Reserve Bank and the FSB.
