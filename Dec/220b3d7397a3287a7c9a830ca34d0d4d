South African bonds were firmer on Tuesday morning, tracking the rand, which has advanced against the dollar. The local currency had gained 1.69% against the dollar at Monday’s close, with the ANC elective conference less than two weeks away. Local political sentiment is driving rand strength and investors have already priced in the prospects of Cyril Ramaphosa wining the nominations for ANC presidency. Bonds have followed the rand’s moves. At 9.01am the R186 was bid at 9.140% from Monday’s 9.240%, while the R207 was bid at 7.945% from 8.050%. The rand was at R13.4707 to the dollar from R13.5214. Sasfin Securities fixed-income traders said that although the nomination outcome could be perceived to have lowered political risks, the broader investor base was likely to remain in wait-and-see mode.
