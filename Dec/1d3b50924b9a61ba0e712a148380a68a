Benni McCarthy says he does not need to motivate his Cape Town City players for Tuesday’s Premier Soccer League clash against Mamelodi Sundowns as he promised an expansive approach to the game. "It’s a good challenge and you know that when you play Chiefs‚ Pirates‚ Sundowns you hardly need motivation‚" said the Cape Town City head coach as his team headed to Pretoria on Monday for their last game of 2017. "My players will be psyched up for it. They’ll all be holding up their hands saying ‘coach‚ look at me‚ I’m ready‚ pick me’. Everybody is going to want to be part of that game." As to his approach‚ McCarthy said: "If you are too cautious‚ you are going to allow Sundowns to take control and do what they do — kill most teams off. "But you must remember that Sundowns have played twice a week‚ every Wednesday and every weekend for a while now and they have been getting away with 1-0 wins. "I look at it and think ‘it’s not like your typical Sundowns’. It shows that too many games is catching up with them and maybe that could be our opportunity. I’m hoping the confidence from getting all three points in our last game [against AmaZulu in Cape Town last Friday] will spur my players on. "We won’t be holding back‚ looking to grind out a result. We want to win. "If we sit back we play into Sundowns’ hands. We must do the unexpected. We must match them in our play and get the opportunities we can to win the game." TimesLIVE
