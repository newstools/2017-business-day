The rand was steady against the dollar on Tuesday just before midday, showing little reaction to better-than-expected economic growth data, with local politics driving the market. Statistics SA reported that the South African economy grew 2% in the third quarter when compared to the second quarter, with agriculture being the greatest contributor to GDP. The rand has been on a firming trend, with the market already pricing in an expectation that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will lead the ANC. The currency firmed to R13.44 to the dollar in earlier trade, and is expected to be volatile ahead of the ANC’s national elective conference on December 16. Investec economist Annabel Bishop said it was unlikely the market had fully priced in the different potential outcomes of the ANC elective conference, and there could be volatility in the rand should it disappoint. At 11.40am‚ the rand was at R13.5282 to the dollar from R13.5214‚ at R16.0382 to the euro from R16.0444 and at R18.1398 to the pound from R18.2281. The euro was at $1.1855 from $1.1866.
