Albany — Tiger Woods’s hopes of a fairytale return faded on Saturday after an error-strewn round saw him tumble down the leaderboard at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas. After solid displays on his opening two rounds had left him at seven under par for the tournament, the former world No1 suffered a torrid third round with a three-over-par 75. "Anything that I did right ended up in a bad spot, and then anything I did wrong it was really bad," Woods said. It left him at four under, 10 shots off the lead held by American Charley Hoffman on the par-72 Albany Golf Club course. Hoffman countered two bogeys and a double bogey with six birdies in a two-under 70 and a 14-under total of 202. American Jordan Spieth and England’s Justin Rose were tied on second five shots back.
