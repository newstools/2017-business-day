South African bonds were mixed shortly before noon on Wednesday, at slightly weaker levels than earlier, despite the rand gaining after consumer inflation for November came in less than expected. Inflation decelerated to an annual rate of 4.6% in November, from 4.8% in October, Statistics SA data showed. A Trading Economics forecast had expected 4.7%. Lower inflation tends to benefit bonds, as there is less erosion of the purchasing power of future cash flows. The rand firmed after the inflation print, but bonds were little moved. Foreign interest in local bonds have decreased in recent weeks, but yields have traded in narrow ranges. Demand at Tuesday’s government bond auction, however, was higher than the pervious week, amounting to R9.5bn in bids compared with last week’s R8.2bn. Foreign investors were net sellers by a small amount on Tuesday, with the auction clearing largely due to domestic investors, said Sasfin Securities bond analysts. Rand Merchant Bank analyst Deon Kohlmeyer said bonds weakened despite this due to the softer rand, as well as market unease ahead of risk events this week. This included the ANC elective conference this weekend as well as the US Federal Reserve monetary policy decision expected at 9pm Johannesburg time on Wednesday. The Fed is widely expected to announce a 25 basis points interest-rate cut. The dollar was under slight pressure on Wednesday after a Democrat won a closely contested Senate race in Alabama on Tuesday. The result was a defeat for US President Donald Trump, who had endorsed Republican Roy Moore, and would trim the Republican Party’s Senate majority from 52-48 to 51-49, reported Dow Jones Newswires. The reduced Republican majority could jeopardise Trump’s policy agenda. At 11.30am the benchmark R186 government bond was steady at 9.29% from Tuesday’s 9.26%, while the R207 was bid at 8.1% from 8.105%. US 10-year treasuries were bid at 2.4076% from 2.3914%. The rand was at R13.6341 from R13.675.
