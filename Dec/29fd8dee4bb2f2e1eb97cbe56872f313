The DA’s national leadership has asked Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille to give reasons why she should stay in her job. In the meantime‚ she has been suspended from the party following "troubling allegations of maladministration in the City". The federal executive said on Thursday night that it had asked De Lille to justify her continued stay as mayor. "In the light of these developments‚ it was the view of the federal executive that the mayor of Cape Town‚ Patricia de Lille‚ needed to be placed on suspension pending the outcome of these ongoing investigations‚" DA spokesperson Phumzile van Damme said in a statement. "The federal executive has also asked her to supply reasons why she should not resign as the mayor. "At this stage‚ no decision‚ other than suspension, has been made‚ pending the provision of the reasons requested by the federal executive." The mayor has been engaged in a public spat with JP Smith, the member of the mayoral committee for safety and security, and both were placed on leave in October as the party tried to do some damage control. De Lille has also been accused by an executive director in her office‚ Craig Kesson, of misconduct and corruption. She hit back by saying a party probe of internal tension was aimed at undermining her government — a response that drew the ire of federal council chairman James Selfe.
