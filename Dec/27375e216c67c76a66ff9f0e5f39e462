Irrepressible coach Pitso Mosimane continued to celebrate his fifth year at the helm of Mamelodi Sundowns after his team went to the top of the log after beating Golden Arrows in Durban on Sunday. A sixth-minute half-volley from Ivorian defender Bangaly Soumahoro was enough to earn the visitors a deserved 1-0 victory and push overnight leaders Orlando Pirates into second place. Arrows slipped to ninth spot on the table. The Brazilians were playing their usual entertaining football and nearly doubled their lead in the 22nd minute. Downs skipper Hlompho Kekana had a chance to score from inside the box but he placed his attempt at goals wide. Arrows looked dangerous every time they launched an attack. Velemseni Ndwandwe tried to set up Kudakwashe Mahachi in the 32nd minute but Downs goalie Denis Onyango reacted quickly to snatch the ball before Mahachi could pounce. This result away from home is not to be sneezed at as Arrows have developed a nasty habit of pulling the rug from underneath Sundowns’ feet over the years, but Mosimane’s charges stood their ground.
