Disgruntled ANC members in Mpumalanga who support presidential hopeful Mathews Phosa have withdrawn the urgent part of their court bid.  The High Court in Johannesburg was meant to hear an urgent bid to have the branch general meetings that nominated "unity" as their candidate, declared null and void, unlawful and unconstitutional. During Mpumalangaâ€™s provincial general congress the majority of the votes were spoilt as branches voted for unity. Advocate Dali Mpofu for the applicants told the court they had settled the matter out of court in a meeting on Monday. It is understood the meeting was held at Luthuli House.  Mpofu said the urgent application was withdrawn and the parties had agreed to seek each other in the internal structures of the ANC.
