Rand Water, a state agency that provides water services to 19-million people, says it has cut new capital expenditure in its 2017 financial year to R2.5bn from R3.3bn a year earlier based on commitments by municipalities to be more effective in water-demand management. This is despite its own expectation of exponential population growth in the main metropolitan areas it services. The revised budget was based on the assumption that a 15% reduction in volumes was the new sustained volume base that would grow an average of 1.75% a year over the next five years, CEO Percy Sechemane said in Rand Waterâ€™s 2017 annual report, which has just been released. Rand Water has a five-year rolling forecast for capital expenditure of R20bn that may vary between 20% and 30%. It expected its capacity to be about 6.6-billion litres a day by 2030. On June 30 2017, its total debt stood at R4.4bn (2016: R4.4bn), which at 33% was below the 50% threshold under its agreement with the government. The utility reported an 8.2% revenue increase for the year to June to R11.98bn from R11.07bn a year earlier. Chief financial officer Matshidiso Nyembe said this was the result of an 11.9% increase in the bulk water tariff. Revenue was, however, negatively affected by a 5.8% decline in volumes sold (from a 1% increase in 2016) because of water restrictions imposed by the national government in the period under review. This helped raise net income by 18.3% to R2.4bn, said Nyembe, as margins continued to expand, edging up to 19.82%, from 19.16% in 2016. She attributed this mainly to the relatively good quality of raw water that lowered treatment costs and to pumping water at off-peak times. Revenue was also affected by financial difficulties at several of its municipal customers, which led to some smaller municipalities defaulting on debt in arrears. The utility maintains an R859m liquidity buffer against this risk.
