Consumer conglomerate Steinhoff International – whose market value has been smashed by allegations of accounting irregularities — has sold 20.6-million shares in Stellenbosch-based investment house PSG Group to raise R4.7bn. The sale represented 9.5% of Steinhoff’s original 25.5% stake in PSG, which holds valuable investments in Capitec Bank, private education venture Curro Holdings and Pioneer Foods. Market talk is that Steinhoff — which is desperately reinforcing its balance sheet — would look to offload the remaining stake in PSG in the near term. The PSG shareholding is a highly liquid position and an effective way for Steinhoff to raise capital quickly. In a statement, Steinhoff said proceeds from the share sale would be used in support of operational activities. Reports have also suggested Steinhoff could mull the sale of all or part of its shareholding in JSE-listed industrial conglomerate KAP. At this point, the identity of the buyer (or buyers) of part of Steinhoff’s PSG shareholding has not been disclosed. If the transaction involved a single buyer then that party would need to be identified on the JSE’s Sens feed in the next few days. Steinhoff indicated the share sale would be settled on Wednesday. Steinhoff’s remaining 16% stake in PSG is worth about R9bn. Market sources reckoned PSG would probably prefer the shares to be placed with a handful of friendly shareholders rather than a single investor. The 25.5% stake is enough to hold negative control of PSG, enabling a single holder to block special resolutions. Although Steinhoff’s large equity stake in PSG seemed out of place in the consumer conglomerate, the companies have enjoyed a friendly association over many years. In 2002, PSG fended off a hostile takeover from banking group Absa (which eventually took over PSG Investment Bank) with the help of Steinhoff International founder Markus Jooste.
