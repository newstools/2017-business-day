Cyril Ramaphosa’s support as next ANC president rose to 43% in November from 36% in August, according to a poll by Kantar Public released on Friday morning. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma’s support declined to 15% from 19%. The market research firm said it asked about 2,000 South African adults living in seven major metropolitan areas to what extent they would support certain candidates to be the president of the ANC. The poll was done between October 30 and November 10. Kantar said Ramaphosa’s average support of 43% was derived from 55% support from black South Africans and 17% from white, coloured and Indian South Africans. Dlamini-Zuma was favoured by 20% of blacks and 4% other races to average 15%. Third-placed Mathews Phosa’s 12% average came from 16% black support and 3% other races support. The drop in support for Dlamini-Zuma may be linked to the deteriorating support for President Jacob Zuma, with only 15% of respondents agreeing that he is "doing a good job as president", down from 18% in August and a high of 58% in November 2009, Kantar said.
