SA is holding its breath as ANC delegates continue to vote for the party’s next president at the national elective conference under way at Nasrec. Months of feverish campaigning and crisscrossing the country by the two frontrunners, ANC MP Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and party deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, have drawn to a close, leaving their fate — and that of the nation — in the hands of 4,776 delegates. Voting kicked off late last night and just one more province had to cast its ballot by midmorning on Monday. On Sunday night both factions met their delegates for a final head count. The race is extremely close, and like the beginning, its end hinges on swing province Mpumalanga. While Ramaphosa is ahead in terms of the number of nominations from branches, Dlamini-Zuma has an edge in terms of the size of the provinces backing her. Meanwhile, inside the plenary, national executive committee member Fikile Mbalula will deliver a report on organisational renewal. Result The announcement will take place after a manual count of the votes in the presence of representatives of party structures from both factions. It is likely to be announced by the ANC’s Elexions Agency this evening. Thereafter, nominations for the party’s important national executive committee are set to open, where a fight over whether delegates are allowed to take a list of 80 names with them into the voting booth will continue.
