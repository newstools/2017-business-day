Four out of five grade 4 children in SA cannot understand what they read, according to an international reading study published on Tuesday. Their poor reading skills load the dice against them for the rest of their schooling careers, as once children progress past the foundation phase in which they "learn to read", the curriculum requires them to "read to learn", said Nic Spaull, a senior researcher in the economics department at the University of Stellenbosch. SA ranked last in the 2016 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (Pirls), which gauged the reading standards of nine- and 10-year-olds in 50 countries. The study, which is done every five years, shows there has been no improvement in SA: it scored 323 points in 2016, compared with 320 points in 2011, but the difference is not statistically significant. "The reading crisis is deeper than previously thought," said Spaull. "When SA participated in pre-Pirls in 2011 we thought 58% of grade 4 children could not read for meaning. However, this was on a separate â€¦ scale. 2016 was the first time that pre-Pirls was put on the same scale as Pirls. The true figure for children who cannot read for meaning is 78%. In 2011 (it was) 77%," he said. To put this in context, in the UK, only 3% of grade 4s cannot read for meaning. Middle-income countries like Chile and Iran also scored better than SA, with 13% and 35% of grade 4s unable to read for meaning, respectively. SA has one of the highest gender disparities in the world, with girls scoring 347 points and boys scoring 295 points, effectively placing girls a full year ahead of boys. The gap has widened since 2011, when girls scored 341 and boys scored 307. Pirls tested 12,810 grade 4 children from 293 schools across SA. They were tested in the language used in their school in the foundation phase (grade 1 to grade 3). Reading standards were highest in the Russian Federation (581 points) and Singapore (576 points).
