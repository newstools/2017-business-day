Matthew Thomson from Rezco Asset Management chose New Gold Palladium exchange traded fund (ETF). Consumers have made a shift to buying more petrol cars in the wake of the diesel scandal in Europe, and this has pushed the price of palladium this year. Joseph Busha from JM Busha Investment Group chose Anglo American. With the rand remaining slightly weaker, Busha believes that Anglo will have increased production in the coming months. The companyâ€™s earning momentum is also three times more than the price momentum. He says that if this trend continues, the share price might go back up to R300 or R400.
