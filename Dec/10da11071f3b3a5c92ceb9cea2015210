Former eThekwini mayor James Nxumalo is among those being touted by KwaZulu-Natal ANC members and leaders as a potential candidate for premier of the province. The ANC KwaZulu-Natal provincial executive committee was disbanded by Judge Rishi Seegobin at the High Court in Pietermaritzburg last Friday after he found that the November 2015 provincial elective conference was unlawful. Seegobin ordered that the KwaZulu-Natal provincial executive committee would remain dissolved — in line with the High Court in Pietermaritzburg judgment three months ago — until the appeal was filed and dealt with by a higher court. Supporters of the two main factions in the province, one led by Cyril Ramaphosa ally Senzo Mchunu and the other by Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma backer Sihle Zikalala, started pondering the future political leadership of the province. Thembinkosi Ndlovu, ANC member in the eThekwini region, said that Nxumalo, who was also the chairman of the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal, was one of the leaders being considered for the premier position. "He is level-headed and a capable leader who will be able to lead the ANC and also repair the partnership between the ANC, Cosatu and the South African Communist Party in the province." Mzwandile Mkhwanazi, the ANC regional secretary in the Lower South Coast who campaigned for Cyril Ramaphosa, said the court had opened up many possibilities. "Look, at the moment our main focus is at the [ANC] conference here in Nasrec. But other comrades are talking about how the void created by the disbandment of the PEC must be filled [provincial executive committee]. "The outgoing national executive committee resolved to appoint a provincial task team that was fair, balanced and inclusive. In other words, a team that will include leaders of both factions who will run the day-to-day affairs of the ANC until the provincial elective conference is held."
