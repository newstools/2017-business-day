A surge in the Dow on Thursday failed to lift the JSE on Friday morning, as market heavyweight Naspers and a firmer rand dampened the mood on the local bourse. The Dow jumped 1.39% on Thursday, despite a delay in US tax reform efforts, while the rand hovered just below the R13.70/$ level. Although the delay was due to political wrangling, the chance of the passage of the bill had improved, with the backing of US Senator John McCain, said FxPro analysts. In mid-morning trade, Naspers had fallen 1.92% to R3,617.06. The media group tracked losses in Chinese associate Tencent, under pressure amid a global shift from tech stocks to banking and financial services shares. Naspersâ€™s pay-TV subsidiary, MultiChoice, is also facing allegations it paid bribes to secure influence over state policy. At 9.30am the all share was off 0.3% at 59,596.4 points and the top 40 was down 0.44%. Industrials fell 0.69% and the property index 0.27%. Platinums were up 0.53% and resources 0.39%. In terms of local shares, Sasol was down 1.16% to R425, despite oil cartel Opec on Thursday agreeing to extend production cuts until the end of 2018. Analysts said this had been priced in. Rand hedge Anheuser-Busch InBev was down 0.51% to R1,562, while Richemont added 0.5% to R117.60. Retailer Steinhoff lost 1.01% to R55.69, while TFG was up 1.9% to R161. Vodacom was down 1.21% to R143.30. Education group Advtech dropped 2.39% to R15.91, after saying it had uncovered fraud by a financial manager in its schools division. This would reduce the revenue and operating profit it had reported for the past three financial years. Curro was down 2.45% to R40.20. At 9.47am the rand was at R13.6672 to the dollar. Gold and platinum were flat at $1,275.29/oz and $940.30/oz, respectively. Brent crude was up 0.53% to $63.01 a barrel.
