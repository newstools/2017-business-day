Steinhoff International attempted to staunch the bleeding by appointing US investment bank Moelis & Company and management consultants AlixPartners on Sunday. "Moelis will support and advise on the group's discussions with its lenders, while AlixPartners will assist on liquidity management and operational measures," Steinhoff said in a statement released on Sunday. On Friday, half an hour before the JSE’s closing bell at 5pm, Steinhoff announced that a meeting with its bankers that was to have taken place on Monday would be delayed until December 19, contributing to its share closing 40% lower at R6. On the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which trades until 8pm on weekdays, the reaction to the announcement was more muted, with Steinhoff closing 15% lower at €0.55. Since the market had time to react to the furniture retailer’s announcement on Friday evening, it may help Steinhoff’s share price halt its slide on Monday. The share was decimated last week with a plunge from R55.80 to R5. Stock exchanges were generally buoyant on Monday morning following better than expected November US employment figures. The US added 221,000 private sector jobs outside of agriculture, beating an economist consensus of 190,000. This helped the S&P 500 index gain 0.55% on Friday, setting the tone for Monday morning where Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index was up 0.43% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was up 0.5%. Statistics SA is scheduled to release October’s tourist accommodation report at 10am, its land transport survey at 11.30am, and its food and beverages report at 1pm.
