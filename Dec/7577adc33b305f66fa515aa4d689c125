South African bonds were flat shortly before midday on Monday, with the market’s focus squarely on ANC politics. The ANC national executive committee is completing its final preparations for its elective conference, starting on December 16. Media reports suggested on Monday that efforts were under way within the party to reconcile competing factions, in order to create a unity ticket. The outcome of the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal’s nomination process could also be made known on Monday. The province, the ANC’s largest, is expected to come out in support of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa has apparently emerged with the most support nationally so far, but it is unclear whether this support will result in actual votes at the conference, analysts said. And if political uncertainty is not enough, the market also has to deal with key data risks this week, Rand Merchant Bank currency strategist John Cairns said. Global markets were focused on Friday’s US nonfarm payroll figure while local markets will focus on Tuesday’s third-quarter GDP figure. Benchmark 10-year bonds have been trading in narrow ranges as the conference draws closer, but foreign investors have been net sellers recently. Nedbank analysts said that foreign investors sold R1.37bn of bonds on Friday with more than R8bn sold over the past week. Risk-assets had, however, found some support at the weekend, when the US Senate passed the tax reform bill on Saturday. This supported the dollar on the expectation that the tax cuts would stimulate the economy. Efforts to reconcile different versions of the bill — those of the Senate and the House of Representatives — continue this week. At 11.30am the benchmark R186 government bond was bid at an unchanged 9.32%, while the R207 was bid at 8.115 from 8.111%. The yield on 10-year US treasuries was bid at 2.3946% from 2.3553%. The rand was at R13.6982 to the dollar from R13.7629.
