Tax revenue has doubled in the past 10 years, according to data from the South African Revenue Service (SARS). Speaking at the launch of the Tax Statistics for the past 10 years, SARS’s head of revenue and research, Randall Carolissen, said personal income tax had been the biggest contributor since the 2008-09 financial crisis. Revenue increased from R572.8bn in 2007-08 to R1.144-trillion in 2016-17, up R571.3bn. In this period, the total revenue collected was R8.13-trillion. Revenue from personal income tax increased from 29.6% in 2007-08 to 37.2% in 2016-17. In the medium-term budget policy statement, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba estimated the tax revenue deficit to be R50.8bn in 2017-18; that is the highest deficit since the 2009 recession. The budget deficit is also projected to widen from 3.1% to 4.3% of GDP. "It’s the impact of a very slow economy. Our personal income tax collection has taken a backseat because business confidence is very low. Companies don’t employ more people. As the economy lifts, tax buoyancy will lift," said Carolissen. Following the statement, Fitch said: "The change in direction of policy-making, away from a focus on fiscal consolidation that we anticipated as a consequence of March’s Cabinet reshuffle, is under way and occurring faster than we had expected." Moody’s added that the change in direction was credit negative. "The current MTBPS is the first fiscal policy document in the past several years that does not have the objective of fiscal consolidation," said Moody’s. At the end of November, S&P downgraded SA’s local currency rating, plunging the country further into junk status. Fitch reaffirmed SA’s credit rating, which is already on junk status, while Moody’s has placed SA on a review — presumably until the 2018 budget.
