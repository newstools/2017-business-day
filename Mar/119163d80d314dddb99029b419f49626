The South African bond market was weaker on Wednesday morning, just hours after US President Donald Trump delivered the much-awaited address to the US Congress.The US president&rsquo;s speech was light on fiscal policy details, although it contained a recommitment to spend about $1-trillion on infrastructure."While it&rsquo;s understandable that these things take time to plan and implement properly, markets have been way ahead of the game since Trump&rsquo;s victory and there comes a time when we need to know exactly what they&rsquo;re rallying on," Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam."It will be interesting to see what the lack of detail in Trump&rsquo;s address does to the rally&rsquo;s momentum, with the Dow having already snapped its 12-day winning streak ahead of the president&rsquo;s speech."The yield on the benchmark R186 bond was at 8.815% in early trade, from 8.790% on Friday, as the rand slipped to session lows of R13.16 to the dollar, from highs of R12.79 last week.
