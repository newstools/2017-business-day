The showdown between Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and the Gupta family will take place in the High Court in Pretoria this week.And Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has until the end of the week to tell the highest court in the land why she should not be held personally liable for the social grants fiasco.In 2016, Gordhan lodged an application for a declaratory order confirming that he could not intervene in the dispute between Gupta-owned Oakbay Investments and the country&rsquo;s four banks. The matter is set down to be heard on Tuesday and Wednesday.Dlamini has until Friday to tell the Constitutional Court why she should not be added, in her personal capacity, to the Black Sash&rsquo;s application regarding the contract between the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and Cash Paymaster Services.She must motivate, in an affidavit, why she should not pay the costs of the matter out of her own pocket.The Constitutional Court on March 17 ordered that the contract between CPS, which administers the payment of grants, and Sassa be extended for 12 months. The invalid CPS contract was supposed to have ended this Friday but has been extended. All eyes will be on the distribution of the grants on Saturday.The highest court in the land, almost two weeks ago, found that Dlamini as the minister was ultimately responsible for the "crisis" surrounding the payment of social grants.The ANC national executive committee met at the weekend and will brief the media on Monday following the three-day meeting.On Tuesday &mdash; on the same day that the High Court in Pretoria will hear Gordhan&rsquo;s application &mdash; the Treasury and the South African Revenue Service (SARS) will brief Parliament&rsquo;s finance committee.Questions about recent controversies are expected to be asked during the meeting, including delays in the refund of value-added tax, the breakdown in relationships, and SARS&rsquo;s second-in-charge, Jonas Makwakwa, who has undergone a disciplinary process.South African Airways will brief the same committee on Wednesday on its quarterly report and will provide some idea of the progress it is making on the turnaround plan and the success of its new board.This is the last week before Parliament goes into recess and MPs return to their constituencies for local work. The constituency period is from April 3 to 21.On Tuesday the Western Cape provincial legislature will debate premier Helen Zille&rsquo;s controversial tweets about colonialism.
