Oakbay Investments on Tuesday withdrew its case against the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) after the High Court in Pretoria accepted its striking-out application.Oakbay wanted the court to strike out the FIC certificate, detailing 72 &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; transactions, which formed part of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&rsquo;s founding affidavit.Jeremy Gauntlett for Gordhan had argued that the FIC certificate showed the dimensions of the seriousness of the matter.The full bench also accepted Oakbay&rsquo;s decision to withdraw its allegation that Gordhan colluded with the banks.&ldquo;In our view there is merit to the striking-out application and this application by the Oakbay group is granted,&rdquo; Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo said.The court also accepted Gordhan&rsquo;s striking out application against the allegation that he had a political motive for bringing the matter to court.In the matter concerning President Jacob Zuma applying to be added as an &ldquo;interested party&rdquo;, Mlambo confirmed that the application was dismissed.&ldquo;Given that he is not party to proceedings there is no point for the court to consider his application,&rdquo; the judge president said.Matthew Chaskalson for President Jacob Zuma asked to be excused from the case.On Sahara disputing the authority of the state attorney to act for Gordhan, the court found that the company had filed its condonation application too late.&ldquo;The 14th respondent has failed to show due course for the late filing&hellip;. We are satisfied that the state attorney has authority to represent the applicant,&rdquo; Mlambo said.Court was adjourned until later on Tuesday afternoon.Advocates were asked to report to the judges common room at 2pm to meet with the judges.Mlambo said it was not too late for parties to decide on a settlement.&nbsp;This was after the court earlier dismissed an application by Zuma to be added as an interested party.&nbsp;
