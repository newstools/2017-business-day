London/Melbourne &mdash; The English cities of Birmingham and Liverpool have expressed interest in hosting the 2022 Commonwealth Games after Durban was stripped of the right on Monday."Here in Birmingham we are already in the advanced stages of producing a detailed feasibility study on what would be needed for a truly memorable games in the city," Ian Ward, the deputy leader of Birmingham City Council, said in a statement. "That is due to be completed in the coming weeks and we are in close contact with the government about the developing situation."Birmingham had already expressed an interest in staging the 2026 Games, as had Liverpool.The BBC quoted a spokesperson for Liverpool City Council as saying they had "already indicated to the government that we are very willing to host them [the 2022 Games] instead."The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) said Durban, which had hoped to be the first African city to host the Games, had failed to meet the promises contained in its bid and the search for a replacement host was now on.Expecting trouble with Durban, the CGF recently acquired the power to choose a new host city without a formal bid process.CGF executive vice-president Kereyn Smith, also the head of the New Zealand Olympic Committee, confirmed the CGF would invite cities seen as willing and capable of holding the games to step in, and said the next host needed to be settled quickly."I think the timeframe is a matter of months, certainly not longer than that," she told New Zealand radio."The president [of the CGF] Louise Martin is working with cities that have the ability and the facilities and they can quickly get the money together to make a commitment to do that."Local media reported that New Zealand&rsquo;s largest city, Auckland, which hosted the games in 1990, had no interest in hosting 2022, citing the city&rsquo;s mayor Phillip Goff.Canadian media said Durban&rsquo;s withdrawal could revive interest in Edmonton, which pulled out of the 2022 bid in 2015, leaving the South African city the sole bidder."This raises the some interesting possibilities ... but the city could not undertake this alone," the Edmonton Journal quoted the city&rsquo;s mayor, Don Iveson, as saying.The 2018 Games will be held on Australia&rsquo;s Gold Coast.Smith said it was a possible but "not preferable" that the Gold Coast could hold back-to-back Games and host 2022.The Australian Commonwealth Games Association was unable to provide immediate comment.Reuters
