Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi on Friday blamed a bungling contractor for part of a roof collapsing at Johannesburg’s Charlotte Maxeke Hospital. He said the contractor‚ who was ordered to leave the premises after the collapse‚ had packed heavy crushed stone on part of a roof that was not designed to carry any load. "It was just outright stupidity‚" he told CapeTalk radio in an interview on Friday. "They went and packed the crushed stone there and I can tell you ... any weight which you put on there it will collapse." The minister’s comments echo those made by a doctor at the hospital, as well as the Gauteng provincial government. DA provincial legislature member Jack Bloom asked: "How did we employ such an incompetent contractor?" Bloom told the radio station that last week part of the ceiling had collapsed at the hospital’s dental clinic, which had forced some people to evacuate the affected area. He said there needed to be an urgent investigation into the structural problems at the facility. Gauteng health department spokesman Prince Hamnca said on Friday that normal service had resumed at the hospital. He said six people who had sustained minor injuries had been discharged. Gauteng MEC for infrastructure development Jacob Mamabolo said on Thursday the contractor doing waterproofing at the hospital "clearly has a case to answer". A doctor at the hospital said the roof was covered in gravel that was moved across to a small section of the roof‚ causing that section to cave in. Mamabolo said a preliminary investigation showed that the contractor "did not do a proper check of the capacity of the structure of the buildings to carry that weight". He also said the contractor had not placed the relevant warning signs in the hospital. TMG Digital
