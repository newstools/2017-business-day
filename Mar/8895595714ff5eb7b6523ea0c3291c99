For someone who is still fresh to the working world, paperwork can be very confusing and boring but if it is not handled carefully then it could result in serious legal issues. Mduduzi Khumalo, Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) commissioner, explains to Masterclass the importance of having your contract reviewed before signing it. Khumalo says it is important to know what kind of contract you’re getting into before signing. “There’s a fixed-term contract, which is for a limited duration. And you have your casual contract, which is as and when you are required. Then you have your indefinite contract, which is for permanent employment.” He says employees should read the terms and conditions of their contract carefully and ask a close friend or relative to read through it if there are parts of it that are unclear. Khumalo also stresses the importance of negotiating the terms and conditions with your new employer and being transparent before signing. “Our magic word is fair. We deal with fairness whether the employer’s conduct is fair or unfair,” he says.
