The JSE opened marginally weaker on Friday as banks, financials, retailers and property stocks retreated sharply on President Jacob Zuma’s Cabinet reshuffle, which included the axing of finance minister Pravin Gordhan. But gold stocks rocketed on a weaker rand despite a flat spot gold price. Early morning volumes at R4bn were higher than opening moves experienced last week. "The move undoubtedly places SA firmly on the radar of global rating agencies, creating a much-increased likelihood of a ratings downgrade in the latter half of 2017," said Momentum SP Reid analysts. All JSE sectors with large foreign shareholdings were sold off on the concern that a ratings downgrade was now inevitable due to incoming finance minister Malusi Gigaba’s closeness to the Gupta family. "The moves in Cabinet have increased the risk of a sovereign downgrade," Momentum Investments analyst Sanisha Packirisamy said, adding that the appointment of Gigaba cast doubt over the strength of SA’s institutions and the direction of economic policy. "These two issues are important for Standard & Poor’s (S&P), which previously noted that institutional credibility and economic factors carried a higher weighting in the sovereign assessment," she said. S&P is set to evaluate SA’s rating on June 2. Moody’s will provide its opinion on April 7.
