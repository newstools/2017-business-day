Old Mutual&rsquo;s managed separation process will incur one-off costs of as much as &pound;230m, but the group estimates that the benefits to shareholders could reach more than &pound;2bn.The group said on Thursday that it was on track to meet its end 2018 deadline to complete the break-up of the group, which it announced a year ago.This came as London-listed Old Mutual announced a 1% increase in adjusted operating profit to &pound;1.67bn, slightly ahead of market expectations.The managed separation process will see the group break up into its four main businesses, with Old Mutual&rsquo;s South African-based emerging markets business and its London-based wealth management business listed separately, while it sells down its stake in its US asset-management business and unbundles its controlling stake in Nedbank to investors.If you are already a subscriber, please click on the following link below to go to the full article: Old Mutual break-up could cost &pound;230mIf you would like to&nbsp;subscribe &nbsp;to BusinessLIVE Premium to read the full story, please&nbsp;click here Subscribe.
