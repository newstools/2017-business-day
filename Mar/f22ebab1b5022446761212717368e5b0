Seoul &mdash; Oil prices dropped to their lowest in three months on Monday despite Opec&rsquo;s efforts to curb crude output, dragged down as US drillers kept adding rigs.Brent crude had fallen 39c, or 0.8%, to at $50.98 a barrel by 5.53am GMT, its lowest since November 30. It closed the previous session down 1.6% at $51.37. US West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) declined 45c, or 0.9%, to $48.04 a barrel, also the lowest since November 30.Brent crude is set to drop for a fifth day, its biggest losing streak since a six-day slump that ended on November 4. During this streak, the price has slumped 8.8%, its worst performance since the middle of June 2016.WTI is set to decline for a sixth day, during which is has dropped 9.8%. The slump in prices has occurred as more rigs are deployed to look for oil in the US and as crude inventories in the US, the world&rsquo;s biggest oil consumer, have surged to a record.US drillers added oil rigs for an eighth consecutive week, Baker Hughes said on Friday, as energy companies increased spending to take advantage of an earlier recovery in crude prices since oil cartel Opec agreed to cut output.Opec and other major oil producers including Russia reached a landmark agreement late last year to rein in production by almost 1.8-million barrels a day in the first half of 2017. Overshadowing the curbs, US crude inventories surged last week by 8.2-million barrels."With the market still digesting the big increase in inventories, oil prices are likely to remain under pressure today," ANZ bank said in a note.Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long positions in US crude futures and options in the week to March 7, according to data from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday.Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at Sydney&rsquo;s CMC Markets, said markets this week would be dominated by the expectation that the US Federal Reserve was set to raise interest rates this week.A rise in US rates would probably buoy the dollar, making greenback-denominated oil more expensive for importing countries."The week ahead is packed with potentially market-defining releases," said McCarthy. "However, the key to market performance this week is the response to the US lift in rates."Reuters
