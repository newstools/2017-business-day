With just a few days to go to the end of the 2016-17 tax year on Friday, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has urged the South African Revenue Service (SARS) to behave in a professional manner and has highlighted the need to defend the strength of SA’s key economic and fiscal institutions, as well as its rule of law institutions. Gordhan said on Friday, however, that the tensions between the Treasury and SARS had been “overstated and overemphasised”. Speaking at a Deloitte post-budget breakfast he spoke of the need for public officials to be aware of their responsibility to contribute to growing and strengthening their institutions and ensuring these institutions gained greater legitimacy among citizens. Gordhan will lead a government, business and labour delegation on a post-budget road show this week to international investors and ratings agencies in the UK and US. He said key factors were how to get confidence and consensus building to become the dominant theme in SA, so that it crowded out the other “noise”, as well as how to ensure the key institutions were defended.
