Law firm Adams and Adams has been appointed to investigate the cause of the roof collapse at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital in Johannesburg‚ which left five people injured last week. The Gauteng department of infrastructure development confirmed the appointment in a statement. "We have appointed a reputable legal firm Adams and Adams to conduct the investigations into these incidents and to provide a detailed report of what really transpired‚" MEC Jacob Mamabolo said. "We have also tasked the investigators to review the competence of all companies appointed to do maintenance in all our health facilities in the province." According to Mamabolo‚ the site of the incident had been sealed off and the investigation was due to begin immediately. The contractor he blamed for the collapse had been removed from the premises. The MEC also responded to claims that maintenance at the hospital had been ignored for years. "We should also appeal to everybody to stop the speculation. The claim that this particular incident happened because the building is neglected is not true. In fact, we appointed the contractor to conduct maintenance work. It is the contractor who was negligent‚" Mamabolo said. TMG Digital
