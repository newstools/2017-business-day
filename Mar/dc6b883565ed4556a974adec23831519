The government intends to adjust the way foreign employment income is taxed to prevent cases of "double nontaxation".South Africans working abroad for a short period enjoyed an "excessively generous" exemption, Treasury said in the 2017 budget review.Jerome Brink, associate in the tax and exchange control practice of law firm Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr, says many South Africans who are seconded by their employers to work in offshore jurisdictions use the exemption offered to them in the Income Tax Act.He says that apart from the 183 full days that an individual must spend outside the country during a tax year, the exemption will only apply if, during that 183-day period, there was a continuous period of at least 60 days away from SA.Treasury says if a South African works in a foreign country for more than 183 days with no tax payable in the foreign country, that foreign employment income will benefit from double nontaxation.It is proposed that this exemption be adjusted so that foreign employment income will be exempt from tax only if it is subject to tax in the foreign country.Brink says in a special budget alert published by the firm that the South African Revenue Service (SARS) issued a revised interpretation note on the exemption in February, due to various "interpretational and practical" issues.One of the main issues the new note cleared up was the "common misconception" that all remuneration received during the qualifying period of 12 months is exempt from tax."The note confirmed that only the remuneration received or accrued in respect of services rendered outside the country during the qualifying 12 month period is in fact exempt," Brink says.Hugo van Zyl, member of the South African Institute of Tax Professionals (SAIT), says internationally the practice is also to exempt foreign income, but in some instances, as in the US, the income earned is capped."In SA the exemption could be unlimited so it is very generous for employees in low tax jurisdictions."Treasury has indicated that a South African who is paying tax in a foreign country can continue to enjoy the unilateral tax exemption."One has to ask how fair this exemption will be as some expats may only pay 15% in the country of employment and enjoy a full 45% tax exemption in SA whereas others have to pay 45% in SA," says Van Zyl.Erika de Villiers, head of tax policy at SAIT, says it is unclear whether the ultimate change would affect only employees who are subject to no tax in the foreign jurisdiction, or whether employees in low tax jurisdictions would also be caught.If a tax credit system is followed, the tax paid in the foreign jurisdiction will be offset against the tax payable in SA."However, a tax credit system has a lot of practical challenges, which will need to be considered. One of the practical challenges will be obtaining proof of taxes actually paid in certain African countries," she says.Van Zyl warns against "overreaction" to the proposed changes. Treasury will still consult widely before any changes are implemented."This is an &lsquo;in principle&rsquo; statement and full public process must be followed, therefor we do not expect any changes before 1 March 2018," says Van Zyl.He also does not see implementation of the changes before the 2019 tax year as the latest interpretation note saw two draft versions before the final issue on February 2 this year.
