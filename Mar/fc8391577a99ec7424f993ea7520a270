Insurer MMI plans to invest in two joint ventures and its short-term insurance offering in a bid for growth after reporting its first half-year decline in core headline earnings since the Metropolitan and Momentum merger in 2010. On Thursday, the company reported a 5% decline to R1.6bn in diluted core headline earnings for the half-year to December, the result of losing two major healthcare administration contracts and losses on its group disability book. It had earlier warned that earnings could drop as much as 10%, with the loss of the Bankmed and Polmed administration licences taking R70m out of earnings, coupled with an extra loss of R57m from higher disability claims. After the presentation of the company’s results, MMI CEO Nicolaas Kruger said the higher disability claims were a result of the weak economic environment. "A number of employee benefits include the disability benefit. The economy in its current state makes working conditions more stressful. You have back pain, or you have depression…. You can’t do your work, so you claim for disability." MMI has R3bn in capital remaining after providing for an interim dividend of R1bn and setting aside R2.7bn for its strategic growth initiatives. Kruger said R1.7bn of this had already been committed to aYo, Aditya Birla and investments in short-term insurance. The aYo mobile insurance joint venture with MTN has already launched two products in Uganda, which MMI is treating as "proof of concept" and will roll out in other African markets when proven. In India, the health and wellness joint venture with Aditya Birla has clinched 96,000 insured lives. Kruger said the group had identified cross-sell opportunities in short-term insurance. MMI has, however, incurred losses of R3m on the joint ventures. "They’re currently unprofitable, but remember we need scale," said Kruger.
