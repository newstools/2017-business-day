The South African bond market was flat on Monday morning despite a firmer rand.The currency, which bonds usually track, showed resilience despite the release of strong US nonfarm payrolls data that made a US rate increase almost inevitable. Markets have already priced in three interest rate increases in 2017.An increase in US interest rates puts pressure on emerging-market economies that are reliant on foreign direct investment to drive economic growth.Rand Merchant Bank analyst Michelle Wohlberg said the sell-off seen late last week in the local currency was mild and not sustained even in the face of the strong payrolls. Although she said rand weakness should be expected this week.At 9.07am the R186 was bid at 8.68%, unchanged from Friday and the R207 at 7.68% from 7.675%The rand was at R13.09/$ from R13.19/$
