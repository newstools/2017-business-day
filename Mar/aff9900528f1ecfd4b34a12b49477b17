Off the town of Inhambane in Mozambique, Jonathan Sharfman is hunting for a new kind of treasure that doesn&rsquo;t gleam like gold, but promises to shed light on a dark and forgotten history.Somewhere not far from the old town lies an 18th-century slave ship that is proving to be extremely difficult to find. What is known is that the vessel struck a sandbar after slaves took over the ship but, besides that, clues pointing to its exact location are scant.The landmarks mentioned in 200-year-old documents marking the site of the wreck have changed, and their units of distance can&rsquo;t be trusted."We don&rsquo;t even know what miles they are talking about &mdash; they could be French, they could be Portuguese," says Sharfman, a marine archaeologist."Archival documents are difficult to interpret, and geographical names change."Mozambique has become the next frontier in the search for slave shipwrecks. Archaeologists and historians are hoping that what they find on the seabed will fill in the gaps about this less-known branch of the global slave trade.So far, the Slave Wrecks Project &mdash; which has initiatives around the world &mdash; has identified a number of potential sites along the Mozambican coast, but what is of interest are the two ships that were wrecked following slave revolts on board."They are interesting because slave rebellions are an under-reported aspect of the slave trade. And it is remarkable how often these happened and how many shipwrecks at particular times in the slave trade can be attributed to this kind of intervention," explains Stephen Lubkemann, a co-director of the Slave Wrecks Project.When the slaves took over the ship off Inhambane, they threw the captain and his personal slave overboard."From what we can tell, the slaves seem to have been losers of a local conflict."They ended up ramming the ship into a sandbank and we know there was considerable loss of life," Lubkemann says.Some of the ringleaders of the revolt were recaptured and executed in Inhambane. Their deaths, according to Lubkemann, were by decapitation.The other ship that was wrecked after a slave revolt is believed to lie off the islands of Mozambique.Lubkemann is not naming the ships they are searching for, as it is his organisation&rsquo;s policy to do so only once they have been found and identified.The Slave Wrecks Project is working in partnership with the Eduardo Mondlane University in Maputo, Mozambique.He says the wrecks along the Mozambican coastline were plundered, but no one is sure what was taken from them.It is believed that between 500,000 and 1.2-million slaves were transported down the east coast of Africa and to colonies in North America, the Caribbean and South America."It is a challenge to work out a figure because so much of the East African slave trade occurred &hellip; when it was either partially illegal or entirely illegal," Lubkemann says.After Britain outlawed slavery in 1807, the east coast route became more popular than the slave shipping routes off the west coast of Africa. The longer coastline on the east of the continent was more difficult for the British navy to police.The east coast slave trading network is far older than the west coast one and was still in operation in Mozambique in the early part of the 20th century."There are some records that talk about slaving in 1910 and 1911," says Lubkemann.The route followed the Mozambican coast line, rounded the Cape then crossed the Atlantic on to Brazil and the Caribbean. It was longer and more dangerous than the Middle Passage between the west coast and the Americas.Some of the slave ships called at the Cape and some were wrecked on SA&rsquo;s coastline. The most famous of these wrecks is the Portuguese S&atilde;o Jos&eacute; Paquete d&rsquo;Africa.The Smithsonian&rsquo;s African American History Museum, Iziko Museums and the Slave Wrecks Project confirmed the discovery of the ship in 2015.Archaeologists recovered iron rectangular ballasts, which are unique to slave ships as they are used to offset the weight of its moving human cargo.They also found copper nails, sheathing and the remains of shackles probably used to restrain the S&atilde;o Jos&eacute; Paquete d&rsquo;Africa&rsquo;s slave cargo.Survivors of some of these wrecks made it ashore and were captured and sold.Other slaves arrived at the Cape as cargo and were sold on the domestic slave market.Many of the descendants of these Mozambican slaves today live within sight of where the ships that brought their ancestors to the Cape once docked or floundered on the rocks. "There is a very large population of people who were brought from Mozambique to Cape Town, there are a lot of connections that people may not be familiar with," Lubkemann says.And there are also communities in Brazil today that can trace their heritage directly back to Mozambique.If the Slave Wreck Project locates these ships off the coast of Mozambique, it will go a long way towards understanding the slave trade, says marine archaeologist Jaco Boshoff of Iziko Museums,"We have no idea what these ships looked like."From the wreck, we can work out how it was put together, how big it was and fill in the blanks," he says.The discovery of African timber at a wreck site suggests that some of the ships plying the east coast slave trade were built in Africa. It would be a bonus if the marine archaeologists find personal items. "Then, hopefully, we can trace where the slaves came from," Boshoff says.But finding these wrecks can take a long time &mdash; up to a decade before scientists can confirm the origins of the vessels.Soon Sharfman will return to Inhambane. He will spend his days in a boat slowly towing a magnetometer, searching for anomalies on the sea floor that might point to a wreck.It is frustrating sometimes, but Sharfman enjoys the work. "I tell people that it is a bit like Indiana Jones," he says, "but most people don&rsquo;t know who Indiana Jones is anymore, so I now say it is like CSI."
