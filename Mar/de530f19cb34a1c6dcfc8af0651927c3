If President Jacob Zuma reshuffles his Cabinet&sbquo; that will be the end of him&sbquo; EFF leader Julius Malema said on Thursday.Malema was speaking during an interview on Power FM&sbquo; where he was asked what he thought would happen if Zuma made changes to his Cabinet."This is the end of him. We must prepare ourselves for a new president."Malema said his party was consulting its lawyers on whether they could pass a motion of no confidence against Zuma should the president move his ministers around."We must take steps. If they don t work at least we ve taken a position " Malema said."ANC members must know they took an oath to protect SA and they must speak to the conscience about the right thing to do."Malema said ANC leaders including ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte speaker Baleka Mbete and ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, were bargaining with Zuma about who should replace Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas whose futures hung in the balance.He said if Gordhan and Jonas were fired the Gupta family would "accumulate a lot of money" before Zuma stepped down as president.TMG Digital
