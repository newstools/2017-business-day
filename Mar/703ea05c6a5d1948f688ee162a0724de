Western Cape premier Helen Zille has turned on her own party‚ saying that the DA risks falling prey to "African racial nationalism". Zille‚ former leader of the DA‚ caused a storm last week after she suggested on Twitter that colonialism had contributed positively to modern SA. The DA then instituted disciplinary proceedings against Zille‚ who has since apologised for offending fellow South Africans. But on Monday Zille fought back in a column published by news website Daily Maverick. "‘Speaking while white’ is considered the ultimate sin‚ in terms of the increasingly popular ideology called ‘critical race theory’‚" Zille said. "The real danger is that the DA‚ in its quest for votes‚ may start to swallow every tenet‚ myth and shibboleth of African racial-nationalist propaganda‚ including the scapegoating of minorities‚ populist mobilisation and political patronage."
