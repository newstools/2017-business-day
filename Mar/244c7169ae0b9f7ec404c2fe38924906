Political pressure against Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini is being ramped up in the ANC-led alliance to compel the party to act against her over the handling of social grants payments.On Monday, the South African Communist Party (SACP) held a bilateral meeting with the ANC&rsquo;s national working committee, which includes President Jacob Zuma, at which it told the governing party it needed to act against those involved in the grants fiasco.The ANC needed to do this to avoid damage to its image caused by the uncertainty over the delivery of grants to about 17-million people on April 1.After its central executive committee meeting last week, Cosatu called on the president to fire Dlamini.Even the ANC Youth League in KwaZulu-Natal, which is perceived to be Dlamini&rsquo;s ally in the party, has called for the minister&rsquo;s removal.Dlamini is president of the ANC Women&rsquo;s League, which is at the forefront of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma&rsquo;s campaign to succeed Zuma at the ANC&rsquo;s December elective conference.SACP second deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila said the meeting was "frank and robust"."What we said to the ANC is they need to take action against all those involved [in the social grants issue]. The ANC cannot afford the current reputational damage," he said.The conduct of those involved had left millions of social grant recipients on "tenterhooks" about whether they would receive their social grant payments.The SACP also discussed corruption, governance, the conduct of ANC leaders and the operations of the alliance.The meeting was adjourned and will be reconvened in three weeks to continue discussions.
