Former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor stands by her controversial social media post about the Gupta family.The distribution of social grants to millions of South Africans may end up in the hands of the Guptas&sbquo; according to Mentor.Mentor dropped this bombshell on her Facebook page on Sunday&sbquo; in response to the brewing crisis over the payment of social grants on April 1.When contacted on Monday&sbquo; Mentor said: "Everything I write down is true." She would not divulge her sources&sbquo; but said her post was in the public interest.This is not the first sensational revelation made by Mentor on social media.Last year she caused a stir when she said she had been offered a Cabinet position by the Gupta family but had declined.Mentor&rsquo;s latest post comes in the midst of a debacle in which the Department of Social Development is yet to sign a contract for the distribution of more than 17-million social security grants from the beginning of April.The contract with the previous payment contractor, Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), comes to an end this month.Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini said on Sunday that the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) would sign another contract with CPS and that grants would be paid on 1 April.CPS&rsquo;s original appointment was declared invalid by the Constitutional Court, but the contract was allowed to stay in place to prevent grant recipients from not receiving their grants.The department and Sassa were given until March 31 2017 about three years to arrange alternative payment mechanisms.The Sunday Times reported on Sunday that Dlamini and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan were summoned to President Jacob Zuma s official residence in Pretoria on Saturday to resolve the social grant crisis.TMG Digital
