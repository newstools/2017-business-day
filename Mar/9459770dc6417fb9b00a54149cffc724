The holding company of armed response group Stallion, CSG, is acquiring Revert Risk Management Solutions for R100m from RTT Group, it said on Thursday.CSG said the acquisition would complement Stallion by helping the group to expand geographically.Revert offers guarding, access control systems and technical installations, closed-circuit television onsite and offsite monitoring, security risk assessments, investigations and consulting, vehicle authentication, personnel and business vetting, and high-risk freight protection."The transaction is in line with our strategy to expand organically and through acquisitions," CSG CEO Pieter Dry said."Our strategic focus is to grow outside our staffing solutions, into service delivery businesses that are more technology based, with a higher barrier to entry than our existing businesses."The deal is subject to the usual approvals from competition authorities and financiers, and is expected to be completed on May 1.
