The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) had until Wednesday afternoon to sign a new contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) or face the risk of defaulting on social grants on April 1, CPS CEO Serge Belamant said on Tuesday.Belamant dropped the bombshell in an affidavit to the Constitutional Court, answering the South African Post Office&rsquo;s application to be admitted as a friend of the court.
