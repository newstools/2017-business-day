Bulls coach Nollis Marais has replaced injured lock Lood de Jager with Jason Jenkins for their Super Rugby clash against the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein on Saturday afternoon. Announcing the squad for the trip to the Free State on Thursday ‚ Marais also confirmed that he has swapped Lizo Gqoboka and Pierre Schoeman around in the only two changes from their opening-day defeat to the Stormers last weekend. De Jager’s unavailability due to concussion will see Jenkins combining with RG Snyman at lock. The two will not have too many problems getting used to each other as they played together in seven matches during 2016’s tournament. They both scored tries when they last faced the Cheetahs in the 23-18 win at Loftus and Renaldo Bothma will fill the vacancy on the bench left by the promotion of Jenkins. Looking ahead to the trip to Bloemfontein‚ Marias said their hosts would be highly motivated as they also lost their opening match of the season. "The Cheetahs will be hurting after that close loss to the Lions last weekend and they will be highly motivated. "I have no doubt that this group of Bulls players are good enough to be real contenders. But that belief will be tested by a side that refuses to give up or accept defeat. We have another massive challenge ahead of us, but I can honestly say that everyone in the squad is looking forward to this. "We were outplayed by a better team in Cape Town. It was a very good reality check and lessons were learned." Bulls captain Handré Pollard scored 29 points against the Cheetahs the last time he faced them in Bloemfontein‚ but he is adamant that everyone is on a clean slate this time around. "What you achieved in the past means nothing if you don’t deliver your A-game every time‚ something we realised again last weekend in Cape Town. We need a performance that will do justice to the hard work done. "In short‚ we need to show that we are serious about winning this competition."
