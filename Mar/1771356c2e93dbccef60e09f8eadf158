Cape Town City striker Lehlohonolo Majoro says his move to the Mother City after spells with Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates has given his career a new lease of life as he looks forward to Friday&rsquo;s clash with Mamelodi Sundowns."I had to work my way up again after coming from Pirates&sbquo;" he said. "It was an honour to be given an opportunity again by coach Eric [Tinkler]."I felt like that in Johannesburg &hellip; I was too comfortable."In Cape Town&sbquo; it&rsquo;s back to square one. I now want to achieve more&sbquo; to achieve better."Cape Town is a blessing in disguise.... There are not many fans&sbquo; not too many distractions. It helps to focus on yourself more than if I was in Jo&rsquo;burg, where you have friends all over. You don&rsquo;t have a chance to do introspection on your own."But now in Cape Town, I have more of that and I believe with the kind of atmosphere we have here at the club&sbquo; it makes you feel at home and want to work even harder to continue the good spirit that we have here in Cape Town."City&sbquo; who have 35 points&sbquo; and champions Sundowns&sbquo; who are two points back&sbquo; will meet at Athlone Stadium on Friday, with the winner guaranteed top place in the standings.The 30-year-old Majoro goes into the encounter after two goals against Baroka FC in a comfortable away win last Sunday&sbquo; which has lifted his tally in the league this season to five."It was very important for me to score because I haven&rsquo;t been playing regularly due to the injuries I&rsquo;ve encountered this season. It is motivating&sbquo; it makes one want to score even more&sbquo; to work even harder."It is what I&rsquo;m planning to do &mdash; to work harder with my teammates and score more for the club&sbquo;" he said.Majoro&sbquo; who won a league title four years ago with Chiefs&sbquo; said City had every chance to be crowned champions in their maiden season."The motivation among us as players and the influence that the coach has on us really makes it a reality."It is possible that we can win the league, but it is not going to be easy or a walk in the park."We&rsquo;ll have to work hard for it because each and every team that is up there [in the title race] are doing their level best to stay up there."But with the focus and the good preparation that we have been doing throughout the season&sbquo; I believe it is achievable."Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane hopes to have Anthony Laffor and Anele Ngcongca back from injury as his side push to take top spot in the Absa Premiership for the first time this season on Friday.Downs were denied taking the lead by a 0-0 draw against Chippa United in an interrupted match at Loftus Versfeld this week. Chippa also held Mosimane&rsquo;s team to a draw in East London three weeks ago.The draws against the Chilli Boys are Downs&rsquo; only results out of seven league games in 2017 that have not been victories&sbquo; as the Brazilians make a charge on defending their Premier Soccer League title. They face another tough hurdle at Cape Town Stadium.Mosimane hopes to have winger Laffor and rightback Ngcongca back from an injury list that also includes goalkeeper Denis Onyango and star forward Khama Billiat."Anthony is training&sbquo; Anele is training&sbquo; so the doctor will give me the green light on if they are available or not&sbquo;" the Downs coach said. "Hopefully, I get both. If I do, then I can have more up-front&sbquo; by pushing Thapelo Morena up. And Anthony [is also] good for the attack."Their draw against Chippa leaves Sundowns on 33 points at the halfway mark of 15 games.They are two points behind both top-placed SuperSport United and Cape Town City&sbquo; though with three games in hand on the leaders and four on the side in second place. Fifth-placed Downs are a point behind third-placed Bidvest Wits, with two games in hand.Mosimane said his side would be wary of City&rsquo;s dangerous attack."City are a difficult team. They are on form&sbquo; they&rsquo;ve got a good attack&sbquo;" he said."And with not many people. Those two in attack cause problems &mdash; Lebogang Manyama and Aubrey Ngoma. We really have to keep our eye on them. But how far can you?"Our aim is also to test their defence. We don&rsquo;t worry about them because they should worry about us."TMG Digital
