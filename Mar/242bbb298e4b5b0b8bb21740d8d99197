The South African bond market was largely unchanged at weaker levels at midday on Wednesday as the market followed marginal gains in the rand.The rand inched to R13.0868/$ from R13.1312 at midday, despite a stronger dollar.The dollar firmed on the expectation of a US rate increase following hawkish comments from US Federal Reserve officials."An increasing perception of a potential early interest-rate hike in March had favoured the greenback over the past 24 hours," analysts at Momentum SP Reid said.US treasuries were sold off accordingly, with the yield of the US 10-year bond at 2.4195% from 2.3641%.The expectation of a March rate increase has now increased to a 60% possibility in the forward market.There was not much market reaction to US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s address to Congress, as he did not divulge greater detail about mooted tax reform and infrastructural spending, preferring to concentrate on immigration issues.At 11.40am the yield on the benchmark R186 was at 8.815% from 8.79%. The R207 was at 7.815% from 7.79%.
