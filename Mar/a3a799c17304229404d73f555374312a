I&rsquo;ve passed two trucks but there are eight in front of me and I can&rsquo;t see past that&sbquo;" he said.Motla said the trucks were driving at no more than 20km/h. Some truck drivers left their vehicles in the middle of the road."The driver is [getting] in and out of his truck&sbquo; just doing things deliberately for the convoy not to move&sbquo;" he said."One guy insulted him&sbquo; very angry. Everybody was very angry&sbquo; even taxi drivers."The situation is bad. They say there are trucks coming from Witbank and other areas of Limpopo who are going to marches in town&sbquo;" Motla said."I don&rsquo;t see any metro police on the road. Normally they would be here &hellip; but today there is no one. Something is not right&sbquo;" he said.The Coal Transportation Forum&rsquo;s Mary Phadi got into an argument with 702 Radio&rsquo;s Xolani Gwala over whether the trucks were blocking traffic.She told him the trucks were not blocking the road, they were driving into Tshwane, but as trucks, they had to drive slowly and were travelling at 20km/h.President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s reiteration of commitment for the independent power producer programme is behind the protest. The forum told EWN it was concerned the use of independent producers would lead to job losses for its members.TMG Digital
