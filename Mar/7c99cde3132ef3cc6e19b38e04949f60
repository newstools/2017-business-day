Andile Lungisa, the ANC&rsquo;s new Nelson Mandela Bay regional chairman, could be hauled before the party&rsquo;s top disciplinary body soon to explain why he attacked secretary-general Gwede Mantashe days before his election at the weekend&sbquo; The Herald reports.In a confidential letter sent to Lungisa on Friday&sbquo; Mantashe slammed his behaviour as contemptuous. Mantashe said he had reported Lungisa to the ANC&rsquo;s top six and laid a complaint for what he called a personal attack by Lungisa published in The Herald last week.At issue was Mantashe&rsquo;s belief that Lungisa should not stand for election as the party constitution prohibited him&sbquo; as a provincial leader&sbquo; from contesting a seat in the regional structure.But Lungisa said in an earlier letter that Mantashe had misinterpreted the rules. He suggested Mantashe was motivated by factional interests.Lungisa has since apologised to Mantashe saying he made the remarks in the middle of a heated campaign.The exchange between the two exposes a more significant rift between President Jacob Zuma who personally endorsed Lungisa s election in Port Elizabeth on Sunday and Mantashe who appears to believe the election was irregular.TMG Digital/The Herald
