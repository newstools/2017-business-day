White monopoly capital is not the white corner caf&eacute; owner&sbquo; but rather the massive firms that &ldquo;control&rdquo; the bulk of the country&rsquo;s economy.This is according to Progressive Professionals Forum president Mzwanele &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; Manyi&sbquo; speaking at an ANC Youth League event in Durban on Friday night.He said that draconian laws in South Africa's Constitution were preventing the transformation of the economy&sbquo; not the corner shop owned by a white person. He said government needed to strengthen the arm of the Competition Commission and pass anti-oligopolies legislation.An oligopoly is a state of limited competition&sbquo; where the market is controlled by a small number of firms.Manyi, who has been referred to as a 'shill for the Guptas' by the writer Palesa Morudu, was one of the panellists at the eThekwini ANC Youth League&rsquo;s economic freedom discussion &ndash; which was held under the theme of &ldquo;monopoly capital vs transformation&rdquo; at the University of KwaZulu-Natal&rsquo;s Howard College on Friday night. Other panellists included former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng&sbquo; newly-elected provincial ANCYL chair Kwazi Mshengu&sbquo; PPF chair Thembakazi Myaka and eThekwini ANCYL chair Thembo Ntuli.Manyi said it was important to know that not all white businesspeople fell under the banner of white monopoly capital.&ldquo;A corner shop of a white person is not white monopoly capital. Some small factory of white person is not white monopoly capital. And a white person just walking down the street is not white monopoly capital.&ldquo;What is monopoly capital? It is the extreme end of a capitalist of this country. These are the people that control the oligopolies of the industry&sbquo;&rdquo; he said.He named banks&sbquo; cellphone firms&sbquo; the &ldquo;construction cartel&rdquo;&sbquo; auditing firms&sbquo; the wood and paper industry&sbquo; metalwork and fuel companies as those that would meet this definition.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m counting all of these so that we understand what we are talking about&sbquo; so that you understand why is it important for the government to come up with anti-oligopoly legislation to tighten the arm of the Competition Commission&sbquo;&rdquo; he said.Manyi also expressed concerns that white monopoly capital owned R15-trillion of the Johannesburg Stock exchange&sbquo; with only 3% owned by black people.&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a shame? If you look at top positions in this country you find that black people&sbquo; Africans in particular&sbquo; are nowhere. Africans&sbquo; black people&sbquo; occupy 10% of all positions at the top and the rest are occupied by white people&sbquo;&rdquo; he said.Manyi also called for changes to procurement policies to realise the government&rsquo;s objective of radical economic change.&ldquo;There are defective procurement policies which by their very nature ensure that that the status quo remains&sbquo;&rdquo; he said.Manyi said policies that needed reviewing and done away with include the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act&sbquo; whose regulations were in fact working against black businesses and empowering white businesses.TMG Digital
