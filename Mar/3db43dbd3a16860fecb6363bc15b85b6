Private education group Advtech reported a 67% increase in after-tax profit for the year to end-December, to R377.9m, swelled partly by receipt of a R23m settlement of a long-running lawsuit. Excluding that item, after-tax profit was up 55% to R350.4m. Revenue rose 24% to R3.35bn. The group’s 78 schools — which include the Crawford, Abbotts College and Advtech Academy brands — remained the primary source of revenue, at R1.64bn, which was up 15% from the year before. Tertiary education revenue grew 28% to R1.25bn, accounting for 37% of group revenue. Revenue in the resourcing division rose 55% to R460.9m, but profit in that division fell 31%. The group said this was a result of difficult economic conditions that had led to delays in finalising appointments, but it reported seeing an improvement in the second half and into early 2017. Advtech has been expanding its tertiary division and now operates 27 campuses across SA. Acquisitions during the year included Capsicum Culinary Studio and a 51% stake in distance learning group Oxbridge. Operating profit overall was up 36%, with schools rising 16% to R354.4m and the tertiary division up 67% to R223.3. The settlement of Advtech’s lawsuit against Andry Welihockyj, Marina Welihockyj and Meridian closes the chapter on a 10-year-long case. A final dividend of 19c per share was declared, for a full-year dividend of 32.5c, up more than 10% from 29.5c in 2015.
