Mumbai — India coach Anil Kumble urged his team to move on from the debacle in the opening Test against Australia as the hosts seek a series-levelling victory in the second match starting on Saturday. Australia triumphed in Pune by 333 runs inside three days, snapping India’s 19-Test unbeaten run stretching back to their tour to Sri Lanka in 2015. While Virat Kohli’s men won in Sri Lanka and West Indies, they also beat SA, New Zealand, England and Bangladesh for six straight series victories. "You can’t keep winning every game. It has to come to an end at some point of time," Kumble said on Thursday. "Twenty games of Test cricket, it’s quite challenging for an international side to keep going out there and winning. That’s what this team has been able to do across conditions." Reuters
