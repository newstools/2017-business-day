Craig Barry of Maties is the leading try-scorer in the 10th edition of the Varsity Cup with seven touchdowns.Dewald Naude of Tuks and UCT&rsquo;s Cuan Hablutzel are next best with six tries, while Jimmy Mpailane (Pukke), Chris Massyn (Tuks) and Edwill van der Merwe have five apiece. Divan Nel of UJ is the competition&rsquo;s leading points scorer with 86, followed by Massyn (74) and Thinus de Beer of Tuks (64).It is Barry&rsquo;s fifth and final season and the talented, hard-running 24-year-old fullback wants a trophy to his name before signing off on this chapter of his promising rugby career.The Paul Roos old boy captains his side for Monday&rsquo;s home clash with high-flying UJ at the Danie Craven Stadium (7pm kickoff)."I&rsquo;ve been in two finals and both times, we lost to Tuks," said Barry. "They top the log and we may once again be the two sides who contest the final game of the season. We lost to them in round one in a close encounter, one we could have won at their home ground had we not conceded points at the death. We put that loss aside and went on to win six in a row, a sign that we are a force to be reckoned with and a serious contender for the silverware that has eluded our grasp for six years."I wasn&rsquo;t around when Maties clinched a hat-trick of titles in 2010, but the class of 2017 would love to add to that unmatched tally."Barry and almost half his squad finish off their studies in 2017 and want to end off in style. The way the side has been playing suggests that the students from Stellenbosch can go all the way again.Tuks have also bagged six wins from seven starts, the sole one-point loss for the 2012-13 champions registered at UJ during round four.UJ lost their first two matches against former winners Pukke and Shimlas and seemed set to make up the numbers again, but the men from the University of Johannesburg have hit back in a big way winning five straight, resulting in a third place as things stand and in with a shot at qualifying for the next round of knockout matches featuring the top four sides.It is between them, Shimmies and possibly Pukke for the two places up for grabs to join Tuks and Maties in the semifinals.Shimmies of Bloemfontein have completed their allotment of eight fixtures in the round-robin phase and are in fourth place, two points shy of UJ, while defending champions Pukke of Potchefstroom sit in fifth on 18 points, five adrift of 2015 winners Shimmies.Pukke host Tuks (4.45pm kickoff) and desperately need a full house of points to edge Shimmies on points differential.Tuks have not won at Pukke for a few years, a stat their coach Pote Human wants to set right."We go to Pukke with one goal in mind, beat them and collect full points to ensure we finish at the summit of the table and get rewarded with a home semi and final if we make it through," he said. "I&rsquo;m confident of a win. The boys showed great character to come back from 23 points down and beat UCT 53-23."
