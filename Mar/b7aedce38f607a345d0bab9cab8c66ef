The South African bond market fell on Friday morning as speculation of an imminent increase in US interest rates gathered pace, strengthening the dollar in the process.Earlier this week, several high-ranking US Federal Reserve officials hinted that a rate increase was on the cards for March, prompting the markets to price in the likely outcome.It is against this background that speeches from Fed chair Janet Yellen and other Fed officials will be closely watched later in the day.At 8.59am, the yield on the R186 was at 8.765% from 8.745% and the yield on the R207 was at 7.770% from 7.760%.The rand was at R13.1251 to the dollar from a previous close of R13.1558."The risk is that the Fed raises expectations too high for March and doesn&rsquo;t deliver, which will once again have people questioning its credibility," said Oanda market analyst Craig Erlam. "Whether markets fully buy into March could hang on the subtlest of hints today from Yellen."The yield on the US 10-year bond hit highs 2.50%, its highest since February 14.
