Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) president Mzwanele Manyi, says the lobby group is studying the latest Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill, adopted in Parliament earlier this week. Prior to its adoption, the bill was sent back to Parliament six months after it had passed it. This was because of President Jacob Zuma’s concerns about the constitutionality of its provision for warrantless searches. Zuma’s action came after the PPF had lodged an objection over the bill’s constitutionality. The National Assembly unanimously adopted the bill for a second time on Tuesday. "We are studying the latest amendments made in Parliament and we are consulting our legal council who will advise us on a way forward," Manyi told journalists in Johannesburg on Thursday. He said the PPF wanted to look at what the effects of the amendments would be. The bill is intended to strengthen measures to combat money-laundering and the financing of terrorism, and in particular will require enhanced vigilance over the financial transactions of prominent, influential persons — including top government officials and business executives.
