The World Health Organisation (WHO) has lauded SA for tackling diabetes and obesity.The organisation said the country had set a good example for other countries with its efforts to implement a tax to help curb the consumption of sugar, adding that it "strongly supports" the sugar tax on beverages.On Thursday Brand SA flagged the WHO&rsquo;s recognition on its website.During his budget speech in February&sbquo; finance minister Pravin Gordhan said the tax would come into effect once legislation was finalised."By implementing a tax on sugary drinks to increase the prices of these beverages&sbquo; SA will be taking a proactive step to reduce the intake of sugars&sbquo; which contribute to unhealthy weight gain and other diet-related NCDs [noncommunicable diseases]&sbquo; including diabetes&sbquo;" said Dr Rufaro Chatora&sbquo; the WHO&rsquo;s representative to SA."SA&rsquo;s stance on sugary drinks&sbquo; and other products that impact on health&sbquo; such as tobacco and alcohol&sbquo; sets an example for other countries to follow. By taking such actions&sbquo; SA is demonstrating that with political commitment and investment in health promotion that it is possible to beat back the scourge of NCDs&sbquo; including diabetes and obesity."About 16-million people die a year of NCDs and WHO member states have pledged to stop the rise of obesity and diabetes.But the Beverage Association of SA does not agree with the tax.In a statement issued after Gordhan s speech the association announced that it was "extremely disappointed" in the announcement of the "discriminatory tax"."There is mounting data showing that taxing one small part of the consumer s daily diet sugar-sweetened beverages represent less than 10% of daily caloric intake will not result in any significant decrease in overall sugar consumption " the association s said in a statement."The recent ITAM [Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology] report on the tax on sugar-sweetened beverages in Mexico for example revealed a minimal reduction of actual calories consumed. When accounting for the real-world substitution on other foods containing sugar experts estimate a maximum reduction of six calories realised in the daily diet."TMG Digital
