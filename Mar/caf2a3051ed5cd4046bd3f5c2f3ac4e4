Earth, wind and fire put a stop to the annual Cape Town Cycle Tour on Sunday.Cyclists were in danger of crashing to Earth due to the gale-force southeaster, while a fire in Hout Bay forced organisers to cancel the 40th edition of the Tour.The threat of protest action in Hout Bay added to the decision.It was the first cancellation of the event in which about 35&sbquo;000 cyclists &mdash; including many from other parts of the world &ndash; would have participated.Videos taken at the start in the city showed cyclists being blown off their bicycles.The organisers said the decision was made to protect the participants from "potential fatality" especially as the riders would have had to traverse Chapman&rsquo;s Peak."This morning presented a number of challenges&sbquo; not least of which were wind speeds considerably higher than predicted yesterday&sbquo;" said David Bellairs of the Cycle Tour Trust."This&sbquo; combined with a large fire that broke out in Hout Bay in the early hours of this [Sunday] morning, and the added risk of protest action en route were all contributing factors to stop the event&sbquo;" he said.A protest was staged near Masiphumelele, which initially forced the route to be shortened. Richard Bosman&sbquo; City of Cape Town safety and security executive director&sbquo; said the protest seemed to be about "contention on land" in the area.The city&rsquo;s firefighters were also battling a blaze in the Imizamo Yethu informal settlement in Hout Bay. A huge effort was still under way to help victims after at least 650 homes were destroyed."The decision to move the event to a different date is something that needs to be discussed. I think it&rsquo;s highly unlikely at this point&sbquo;" Bellairs said.When asked whether they would start the Tour at a different point in the future, he said: "It&rsquo;s the first time we&rsquo;ve had these kinds of wind speeds at the foreshore and it could very well be a possibility."Bellairs said no one would be refunded for the event.Cyclist Greg Anderson from Cape Town said he understood why the race had to be cancelled and that he would do it again next year. "It&rsquo;s not a major train smash that it was cancelled. I just feel for all the guys and girls who have come from far away."He suggested the organisers reduce 2018 registration fees by half for the people who were going to ride in 2017 and donate the rest of the money to charity.Tasleem Jackson&sbquo; 34&sbquo; of Strandfontein was on his way to the start of what would have been his fourth Tour when it was cancelled."[Cancelling] was the best decision considering the protests&sbquo; the fire in Hout Bay and&sbquo; add to that&sbquo; the wind. If the pros can&rsquo;t handle the wind&sbquo; the amateurs have no chance."I m a tiny bit disappointed because I m not getting a medal. It s the small shiny things "&nbsp;he joked.Two participants from the UK Philip Robinson and his wife Caroline said the Tour would have been the "icing on the cake" of their visit to SA."Judging by the videos I ve seen of people starting I think it was probably the right decision. Disappointing, of course but that s not the only reason we came to SA " said Philip. "We ve been looking forward to it for the last few months especially my wife as she doesn t get to cycle as much as I do " he said."We booked it last April so it s a little disappointing but I m glad I m not cycling in that wind " said Caroline.Philip said they would come back and try again.The organisers said they were "humbled" by the outpouring of offers to assist and donate food to the victims of the fire. "We are in the process of co-ordinating efforts to ensure that goods reach those in need " they said.They announced on Sunday that all food and drink from the cancelled Tour s hospitality venues and water points would be donated to the victims."We encourage the public wishing to donate to contact Thula Thula in Hout Bay to donate nonperishable goods."The mayor of Hout Bay has opened the Hout Bay Sports Centre in readiness to receive perishable goods for immediate distribution to the community."TMG Digital
