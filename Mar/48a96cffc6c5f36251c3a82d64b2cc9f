State-owned arms manufacturer Denel has applied to the High Court in Pretoria for an order declaring that it obtained approval to form a joint venture with VR Laser Asia, which resulted in Denel Asia being established.Denel said on Friday that it had on numerous occasions tried to work with National Treasury to explain the legal processes followed to establish the Denel Asia joint venture, but the matter remained unresolved and continued to "unfairly cast doubt" on the company&rsquo;s reputation and governance regime.Acting Denel CE Zwelakhe Ntshepe said Denel maintained that Denel Asia was duly established following and complied with the relevant prescripts of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA)."We acted lawfully and in accordance, and compliance, with the provisions of sections 51(1)(g), 54(2)(b) and 54(3) of the PFMA in concluding and forming the joint venture agreement," he said.In October 2016, Business Day reported that documents submitted to the public protector as part of her probe into state capture showed that Denel had been caught in a lie over the formation of Denel Asia with Gupta associate Salim Essa.Denel, which formed the joint venture without the permission of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, itself a contravention of the Public Finance Management Act, claimed at the time that the rationale for choosing VR Laser Asia as a partner was the strong relationship it had with its SA-based company, VR Laser.Essa, the sole shareholder of VR Laser Asia, has denied in a letter from his attorney, attached to the documents, that there was a link between the two companies.It has also emerged that Essa contravened exchange control regulations when he established VR Laser Asia, because he used his travel allowance to do so, and did not obtain Reserve Bank permission.He has since asked the Bank to regularise this transaction.Ntshepe on Friday said doubts cast over Denel Asia&rsquo;s legal standing had created negative perceptions about Denel and these had impeded on its ability to do business effectively."The Asia-Pacific region is an extremely important region for Denel to expand its business and find new markets for our world-class products, especially in the fields of artillery, armoured vehicles, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles."He said research showed that by 2018 the Asia-Pacific nations would command more than half of global defence procurement outside the US and two-thirds of non-US defence markets."We need a firm foothold in this region and the establishment of Denel Asia will give us a strong presence and the ability to pursue the desperately needed opportunities in that region," said Ntshepe.He claimed that because of the unresolved legal standing of the company, Denel had already missed out on a number of lucrative business opportunities.This was something Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown said recently, as well.The court application was lodged on Friday.
