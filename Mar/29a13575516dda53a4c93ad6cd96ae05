The South African Institution of Civil Engineering (SAICE) is concerned that SA&rsquo;s standing in the International Engineering Alliance&rsquo;s accords, which establish mutual recognition of qualifications between SA and other signatories, could be in jeopardy. It says the Engineering Council of SA (Ecsa) has been constituted illegally.Ecsa, a statutory body established in terms of the Engineering Profession Act, accredits engineering programmes, registers people as professionals in specified categories and regulates the practice of those registered people.SAICE CEO Manglin Pillay said that in 2016, Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi was supposed to appoint 50 people to Ecsa&rsquo;s new council, using a list approved by the former Ecsa council, a requirement of the act. The minister appointed other people in September from a different list that the old council had not approved, "creating an illegal council and threatening the integrity of South African engineers&rsquo; qualifications".Ecsa had refused to have the council reconstituted using the correct list. SAICE and 14 voluntary associations were suing the minister and Ecsa in the High Court in Pretoria.Ecsa was a signatory to the Washington, Sydney and Dublin accords, the members of which are expected to establish and enforce internationally bench-marked standards for engineering education and expected competence for engineering practice. Members are then able to work and study in each other&rsquo;s jurisdiction.Chris Campbell, CEO of Consulting Engineers SA, on behalf of whom SAICE is acting in the legal matter, said "international accreditation through the accords is dependent on a peer-review system for professional registration with Ecsa"."I believe the new council wants to replace this system with another system, which compromises the recognition of professionally registered engineering practitioners internationally," Campbell said.Ecsa said it would not comment further until a court had ruled on the matter. The Department of Public Works said they could not respond as the issue was sub judice.
