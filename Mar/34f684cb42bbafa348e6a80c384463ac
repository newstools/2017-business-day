The SABC, which has been lurching from one crisis to another, will now have greater chances of recovery after President Jacob Zuma on Sunday confirmed the appointment of an interim board.Former CEO of Business Unity SA, Khanyisile Kweyama, will chair the interim board that will contain former board member Krish Naidoo, media veterans Mathatha Tsedu and John Mattison, and Febe Potgieter-Gqubule, who was until recently the deputy chief of staff of former African Union Commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. The president has designated Kweyama and Tsedu as chairperson and deputy chairperson of the board, respectively."We wish Ms Kweyama and her team well as they begin the important task of leading and revitalising one of the most important national resources, the SABC," Zuma said.&nbsp;The board&rsquo;s first task will undoubtedly be to implement the recommendations by Parliament&rsquo;s ad hoc committee on the SABC&rsquo;s governance lapses.The committee&rsquo;s report includes a forensic investigation into dodgy SABC deals, contracts, salary increases and bonus payments.It is also likely to look into the validity of the memorandum of incorporation, review editorial policies and ensure that competent executives &mdash; including a permanent CEO, chief operating officer and chief financial officer &mdash; are appointed.Another major issue will be the body&rsquo;s financial crisis. Earlier in March, the SABC confirmed it was funding operations from dwindling reserves.Advertising spend dropped significantly, and strategic partners withdrew their engagement to finance additional channels the broadcaster was due to launch in preparation for digital terrestrial television.
