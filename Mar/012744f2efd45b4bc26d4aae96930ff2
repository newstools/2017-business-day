The South African bond market was weaker at midday on Thursday as the rand lost 0.74% against the dollar.Meanwhile, a firmer euro meant the dollar could not hold on to earlier gains in morning trade, and despite this, the rand was weaker.Analysts have been disbelieving at the recent strength of the rand, saying higher US interest rates and softer commodity prices made the rand vulnerable. The rand firmed to R12.79/$ in February.Local bonds also gained in the process, with the R186 firming to 8.57% in February. A weaker rand usually causes local bond yields to rise on inflationary issues."We expect local bond yields to track the currency as we await US nonfarm payrolls on Friday," Rand Merchant Bank analyst Deon Kohlmeyer said.At 11.40am the benchmark R186 was bid at 8.71% from 8.65% and the R207 was bid at 7.70% from 7.64%.The rand was at R13.2391/$ from R13.1423.So far local bonds have not benefited much from the sell-off in US bonds, with the US 10-year bond at 2.5690% from 2.5170% previously.The yield was at 2.44% in December but has risen over the last two months on higher inflationary and rate expectations in the US.Technical analysis shows the yield could rise further over the short term."Given expectations for Fed rate hikes fairly soon, we are likely to see the 2.80% mark targeted for support in the near term, with resistance at 2.30%," analysts at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking said.Nedbank said momentum indicators were heading towards oversold levels and a yield pause may develop at 2.64%.
