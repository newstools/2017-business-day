Amajita qualified for the U-20 World Cup by reaching the semifinals of the Caf U-20 Africa Cup of Nations in Zambia.SA coach Thabo Senong travelled on Monday night to South Korea to attend the draw.From pot 1, SA stand to draw South Korea&sbquo; Portugal&sbquo; Uruguay&sbquo; France or the US.

Also in that pot are Zambia.Honduras&sbquo; Saudi Arabia&sbquo; and Venezuela would be considered the softer draws from the pot.Amajita are joined in pot 4 by Iran&sbquo; Vietnam&sbquo; Ecuador&sbquo; Guinea and shock first-time Pacific island qualifiers Vanuatu.TMG Digital
