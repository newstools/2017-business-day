Shareholders in Merafe, a company that operates furnaces producing ferrochrome in partnership with Glencore, will receive a 4c final dividend. This takes its total dividend for 2016 to 4.8c, more than double the 2.19c paid in 2015. Merafe’s share price rose 2.14% to R1.91 after it released its results for the year to end-December on Tuesday morning. Revenue jumped nearly 30% to R5.7bn, boosted by higher production and a weaker rand. Although the average European benchmark ferrochrome price declined by 11% from $1.07/lb in 2015 to $0.96/lb in 2016, Merafe earned more thanks to the rand weakening 15% from R12.8/$ to R14.7/$. Ferrochrome prices rebounded to $1.65/lb after the reporting period, the highest since 2008. "The price increase was indicative of a market still in deficit, and highlighted the positive sentiment for 2017," the company said in its results statement. Ferrochrome is used to make stainless steel. "Stainless steel production is projected to increase by 3.5% in 2017 and 3.8% in 2018, indicating strong demand prospects for ferrochrome in the short to medium term. The venture is well positioned to take advantage of the increased demand," Merafe said in the outlook section of the results statement. Merafe has been a major beneficiary of more stable power from Eskom, helping its ferrochrome sales volume grow 18% to 437,000 tonnes from the previous year. Besides more reliable power, Merafe’s production also benefited from operating its Lion II furnace for the full year whereas it was ramping up in the first half of 2015. "Total production cost per tonne increases were well below inflation, which is an exceptional achievement especially in light of above-inflation price increases in electricity and labour, the impact of the weaker rand on imported reductants and higher UG2 input costs," CEO Zanele Matlala said. "This was primarily as a result of higher production volumes, the impact of low cost volumes from Lion II and various cost saving initiatives across all operations."
