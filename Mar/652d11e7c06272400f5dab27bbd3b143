The Reserve Bank has had numerous engagements with the South African Security Agency (Sassa) and the Department of Social Development to discuss future options for the payment of social grants, the head of the bank&rsquo;s National Payment System department, Tim Masela, said on Wednesday.Masela made a presentation to Parliament&rsquo;s social development committee, which is concerned about the lack of preparation on the part of Sassa and the Department of Social Development for the payment of nearly 17-million grants once the contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) expires at the end of the month.The contract with CPS, a subsidiary of Net1, was declared unlawful by the Constitutional Court three years ago but was allowed to remain in place so that grant recipients would not be left in the lurch.Sassa has not made alternative plans to take over the payment of grants and starts negotiations with CPS on Wednesday about the extension of its contract.Sassa approached the Constitutional Court seeking permission to extend the CPS contract by a year, but on Wednesday withdrew the case.Masila said Sassa needed to decide on a payment system "urgently".He said the Reserve Bank was not in a position to express an opinion on whether Sassa would be in a position to mitigate risks relating to the current transition or takeover of the system as the committee expected it to do.It could offer regulatory guidance to Sassa if this was required."The Reserve Bank expects Sassa to exercise its choice (of payments system) with due regard to compliance to the regulatory framework of the national payments system and preferably adhering to the principle of interoperability."The open architecture approach supported by the Reserve Bank is based on the principle of interoperability and avoidance of concentration risk while leveraging the existing infrastructure of the national payments system," Masila said.The benefits of an open architecture system included greater choice of banks by beneficiaries, the inclusion of special Sassa features, the avoidance of repeated tenders and the probable lowering of costs.Masila said the Reserve Bank believed Sassa should leverage off existing infrastructure where this was appropriate to prevent duplication.An open architecture would enable competitive product offerings to beneficiaries.It would allow a beneficiary to select an account at the bank of their choice. A co-branded product with Sassa and the banks could be considered."This open co-branded offering would limit the need for a &lsquo;winner takes all&rsquo; tender approach and promote competitiveness amongst banking providers," Masila said.Such a system would use the existing payment system infrastructure and would probably result in lower costs.A specific tender might be necessary to ensure payments in remote rural areas. If the Postbank were used for this purpose, it would need to build the necessary capacity.Masila said CPS&rsquo;s use of Grindrod Bank &mdash; a relatively small bank with no branch network and limited infrastructure &mdash; contributed to operational difficulties for the national payment system when the current grant payment system was launched in 2012.Answering questions about why the Bank had not acted against the unlawful and unauthorised deductions from the bank accounts of beneficiaries, Masela said this was subject to other regulatory authorities. It regulated only Grindrod Bank.He agreed abuse was taking place with regard to deductions.Deputy registrar of banks Unathi Kamlana said the problem of unlawful deductions was not limited to small banks but was a wider problem that needed to be addressed.Department of Social Development director-general Zane Dangor said it was discussing the various payment options with the Reserve Bank and Treasury.What was of particular importance to the department and Sassa was to prevent unlawful deductions, and this was more difficult to control under an open architecture system.If the Reserve Bank were the regulator of the new system, Dangor said, it would have to adopt the department's regulations preventing a multiplicity of deductions from beneficiary bank accounts and to ensure that the accounts were "sanitised".
