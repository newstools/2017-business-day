The JSE was hardly changed on Wednesday morning after the Dow closed lower, bringing its run of 12 consecutive record highs to an end.The Dow closed before US President Donald Trump completed his address to Congress, but investors were sceptical ahead of the address amid concern that Trump would not provide much detail about expected tax reforms and infrastructural spending programmes.That proved to be the case, with the president focusing on immigration issues and security."US markets closed in the red as Trump&rsquo;s address to Congress failed to provide any detail as to how he would finance his infrastructure plans, [there was also no detail on the] repealing of Obamacare and tax cuts for the middle class," Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) analysts said.However, analysts noted that Trump had appeared more presidential than before. "Trump&rsquo;s joint address had, in general terms, a Reaganesque, optimistic tone and it was by far his best and most presidential speech to date," said DeVere Group analyst Nigel Green.The Dow closed 0.12% lower at 20,812.24 points.
