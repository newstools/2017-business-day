Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has instructed the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) to inform the Constitutional Court whether it has entered into a new contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS).He gave Sassa until Monday to provide the court with full details of any agreement.Mogoeng&rsquo;s directive forces Sassa&rsquo;s hand to be more transparent and reveal details of its agreement with CPS.Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini was unable to answer questions about the new CPS deal when she appeared before Parliament&rsquo;s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) earlier this week and when she addressed the media last week. Mogoeng made the request for further information on Wednesday after a follow-up report on the payment of social grants was lodged with the court last week by Dlamini and Sassa acting CEO Thamo Mzobe.In the report, the two told the court the payment of social grants no longer fell under its supervisory jurisdiction.But in his directive Mogoeng said the court&rsquo;s order, discharging its oversight role, was based on Sassa&rsquo;s progress report filed in November 2015 setting out how it would take over paying grants at the end of March 2017.The chief justice said if there was an agreement, a copy had to be provided to the court.The agency also needed to tell the court what steps it took to ensure it complied with procurement legislation. Mogoeng also wants to know who was responsible for determining that Sassa would not be able to pay the grants itself by the end of this month, when the agency became aware of that reality and why the Constitutional Court was not informed.He also wants to know whether Dlamini was informed of this and, if so, when.The Constitutional Court wants to know if there was an agreement with CPS and if this was "lawful and in compliance with the procurement requirements of the constitution and applicable legislation"."Full details are required of the steps taken in compliance with applicable procurement legislation," the court said.It asked Sassa and the minister whether either would have an objection to "independent monitoring" of any agreement with CPS. If so, Mogoeng wanted to know the nature and content of the objections.The Constitutional Court wants details of the steps taken, or envisaged to be taken, to run a competitive bidding process for the contract to distribute grants.It also wants details of the steps to be taken to ensure Sassa would be able to administer and pay grants in the future and a time frame for this.During her appearance before Scopa, Dlamini said no new contract had been signed with CPS. She said a technical negotiating team would submit its report by Thursday.Earlier this week, Net1 CEO Serge Belamant said CPS had agreed to a set of terms.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has been asked to appear before Scopa.Sassa will need to get the Treasury s approval for deviating from the Public Finance Management Act because the contract has not been put out to tender.Advocacy group Black Sash has approached the court on an urgent basis, asking it to reinstate its oversight role.The DA applied to intervene in the matter. However, the court dismissed this, saying it was "not in the interests of justice" to hear its application at this stage.Freedom Under Law has also applied for leave to intervene, which the court will hear together with Black Sash s application on March 15.
