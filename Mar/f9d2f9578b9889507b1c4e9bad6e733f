World 400m record holder and Olympic champion Wayde van Niekerk insists he will take part in the South African championships in Potchefstroom and not the world relay championships in the Bahamas in April. Athletics SA created the confusion when they scheduled the national championship on April 21-22‚ the same days as the IAAF’s relay championships. ‘‘I will be in Potch and putting on a show for SA‚" Van Niekerk said on Thursday. ‘‘It is time for us to give South Africans a show here at home, so you do not have to watch it  on TV." The date of the world relay championships was known well before the dates for the national championships and yet Athletics SA set the schedule. With Van Niekerk confirming his participation in Potchefstroom‚ the 100m is expected to produce fireworks, with a potentially mouthwatering final line-up a possibility. Van Niekerk could line up in the final against national record holder Akani Simbine‚ Thando Roto‚ defending champion Henricho Bruintjies and young gun, Gift Leotlela. Van Niekerk did not want to make predictions and said it would be a lightning-quick race that could be the highlight of the championships. ‘‘Simbine’s 9.89sec 100m national record is a massive South African record to beat. ‘‘But we will put out our best foot forward and see what happens."
