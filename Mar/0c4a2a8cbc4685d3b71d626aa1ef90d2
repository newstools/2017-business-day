ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe is concerned that flouting the party&rsquo;s constitution to accommodate the newly elected Nelson Mandela Bay chairman Andile Lungisa could "open up a can of worms".Lungisa contravened party rules when he accepted nomination to lead a lower structure while sitting on the party&rsquo;s provincial executive committee.When Mantashe warned him about this, Lungisa publicly insulted the secretary-general, saying he was "protecting his faction".The matter cuts to the heart of the organisational problems faced by the ANC, highlighted in its policy discussion documents that rules are applied selectively according to allegiances.Lungisa&rsquo;s election was reportedly praised by President Jacob Zuma.ANC alliance partner the South African Communist Party complained that the so-called "Premier League" faction, seen to have Zuma&rsquo;s backing, should have been dismantled when its existence emerged. Lungisa is reportedly aligned to this group and Zuma.Mantashe told Business Day on Tuesday that flouting the rules in one instance could expose the ANC to further challenges as there was a long list of leaders who were prevented from standing for positions on lower structures due to the same rule.Lungisa is set to face disciplinary action for his personal insults against Mantashe.However, the national disciplinary committee has not yet received a charge sheet on the matter.Lungisa&rsquo;s election may be contained in a report to the ANC&rsquo;s national executive committee (NEC), where it will likely be discussed.Mantashe said if the ANC "fudged" the party&rsquo;s rules in respect of Lungisa, it could result in others doing so."If we handle this clumsily, it will open a big can of worms because there is a long list of people who were stopped from standing in lower organs," Mantashe said.He said leaders such as NEC member and Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane and NEC member and Deputy Agriculture Minister Bheki Cele had been told to "back off" when they sought to stand for election on lower structures of the party.Lungisa was elected at the governing party&rsquo;s Nelson Mandela Bay regional conference last weekend.The troubled region has been under the stewardship of a task team since 2014, when its former regional executive committee was dissolved.Factionalism and turbulence in the party was a contributor to the ANC&rsquo;s decline in electoral support in the Nelson Mandela Bay metro.This culminated in the loss of the metro to a DA-led coalition in the 2016 local government election.Mantashe said the matter regarding Lungisa&rsquo;s eligibility to stand for election was one of organisational discipline.He also said that he had noted an apology by Lungisa for his personal attack, but said that it was no longer in his hands &mdash; it was now subject to processes within the party.
