Hong Kong &mdash; Ian Bell is hoping success in Twenty20 cricket will help to convince England&rsquo;s new hierarchy that he is ripe for a return to the national team.The middle-order batsman has not played a Test for more than a year but after a stint in Australia&rsquo;s Big Bash League, he is turning his attentions to this week&rsquo;s T20 Blitz in Hong Kong.Bell, 34, averaged 33 in 10 Big Bash games for Perth Scorchers and he knows runs on the board are the only way to get back into the England reckoning."I&rsquo;ll have to start the [County] season well," Bell said here, where he is among several big names to play the T20 Blitz&rsquo;s second edition."I&rsquo;ve had conversations with England so the door, I know, isn&rsquo;t shut, so maybe there&rsquo;s a couple of places up for grabs."So if I can start the season well, which is one of the reasons I wanted to come here&hellip; by the time I get back in April, hopefully I&rsquo;m a bit further down the line."While Bell lines up for HKI United at Hong Kong&rsquo;s modest Mission Road ground, his former England colleagues are wrapping up a three-match one-day series in the West Indies.Bell said he was watching the effect on the team of Joe Root and Ben Stokes, England&rsquo;s new Test captain and vice-captain respectively, with interest."It&rsquo;s going to be intriguing, especially with an Ashes series round the corner this time [in 2016]," Bell said. "With [Root] and [Australia&rsquo;s] Steve Smith you&rsquo;ve got two of the best young players of the world, who are captains as well."AFP
