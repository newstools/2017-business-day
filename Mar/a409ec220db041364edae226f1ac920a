The rand was hardly changed on Friday morning after losing ground during the week on a stronger dollar amid the expectation of a US rate increase in March.Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) analysts said the rand was under sustained pressure as the possibility of an increase in US interest rates had increased. The rand has lost 1.4% against the dollar since Monday. A number of US Federal Reserve officials have been hinting at the likelihood of March rate increase.TreasuryOne currency dealer Andre Botha said the rand seemed to be on a bit of a weakening path with the dollar firming quite steadily. "One can expect that next week&rsquo;s US nonfarm payroll figures will substantiate the view that the US is on course for a rate hike," Botha said.Fed chair Janet Yellen is due to give a speech on the US&rsquo;s economic outlook later in the day.Botha said if the expected hawkishness continued, the rand was set to weaken further. "Even with the rand losing some ground, we are still firmly entrenched in very tight ranges with a break on the upper end of the range looking more likely in the coming weeks," he said.The rand was slightly weaker against the euro, but had firmed against the pound.Nedbank CIB analysts said the international currency markets remained "non-committal".At 9.26am the unit was at R13.1346 to the dollar from Thursday&rsquo;s R13.1558, R13.8201 to the euro from R13.8221, and R16.1088 to the pound from R16.1375.The euro was at $1.0524 from $1.0506.
