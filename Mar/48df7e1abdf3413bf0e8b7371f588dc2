Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini may have the terms of a new contract with Cash Payment Services (CPS) in the bag, but she will have no choice but to return to the Constitutional Court to regularise it. Dlamini and acting CE of the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) Thamo Mzobe. have sought to put an end to the court’s oversight of Sassa. In a report lodged last Thursday, Mzobe said “it is no longer obliged to report to this court”. Sassa and the department are expected to meet with the Treasury on Tuesday to discuss the terms of a new contract they have negotiated with CPS. Acting chief procurement officer Schalk Human said the Treasury was obliged to inform Sassa that in order to regularise the new contract, it would have to get the permission of the court. Only after that would it consider consenting to a deviation to the tender process.
