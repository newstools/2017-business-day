An asset-grabbing mindset was sweeping through SA&rsquo;s transformation conversation, Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas warned on Monday.Jonas delivered this verdict in a 10-minute opening address at the Gordon Institute of Business Science (Gibs), which was a precursor to his conversation about ethics with radio journalist Stephen Grootes.The deputy finance minister told the Gibs audience much had improved over the past 20 years, but more needed to be done to address unemployment and inequality.However, he conceded that corruption had constrained SA&rsquo;s ability to become a bona fide developmental state.The government and business had been complicit in the current state of affairs.The state could have done more in improving education and training outcomes; it could have performed better in regulating the cost of energy and logistics; and it could have done a better job in managing state-owned entities.He also identified rent-seeking as being fundamental to the lack of change in the structure of the economy, which has not created new assets or wealth."Rent-seeking is at the essence of state capture because of the [current model of redistribution]," he said. "The narrow interpretation of redistribution is changing the ownership of current assets."Simply changing the colour of ownership without restructuring the economy will create a new [black] elite," charged Jonas."An asset-grabbing mindset is sweeping through the country, but it will have no effect on growth or inequality," Jonas told the audience.By the same token, the private sector could have also done more, said Jonas, citing as an example the fact that banks could allocate more capital. But the state remained concerned about the low levels of fixed-asset investment and needed to work on lifting business confidence to unlock this investment, Jonas said."We must all agree on the need to change. We are calling for consensus."Certainty is needed so that everyone knows where we stand in light of the contradictory, and sometimes foolish, public statements [around radical economic transformation]," Jonas said.
