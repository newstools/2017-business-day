Mzwanele Manyi resigned from the Black Business Council (BBC) on Monday. Manyi was elected as Head of Policy in September 2016.  Manyi explained that his resignation was “due to ever increasing responsibilities and time constraints.” The BBC, which has recently been in talks with National Treasury and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan about creating a budget that champions radical economic transformation, was accused of trying to capture the Treasury two weeks ago and of being in the pockets of the Gupta's. While BBC President Danisa Baloyi said she had never met a Gupta, Manyi has come out in the past about his support for the family. Manyi did not attend the follow up meeting with the Treasury after attending a briefing at Nedlac, which reportedly turned sour.
