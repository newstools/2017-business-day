London — European stocks fell for a third consecutive day on Tuesday, once again dragged down by financials as shares in Deutsche Bank slid on deepening concern about its health after its $8.5bn cash call. A batch of weak corporate earnings reports and the biggest fall in German industrial orders since the depths of the global financial crisis also disappointed investors, setting the tone for a lacklustre session in Europe. Europe’s leading index of the top 300 shares fell as much as 0.5%, with the region’s banking index down as much as 0.7%. By 9.45am GMT the FTSEuroFirst had clawed back ground to trade only slightly lower on the day, and financials were down 0.3%. Deutsche shares fell almost 3% to a fresh 2017 low. They have lost more than 10% in the past few days since the bank said it would tap investors for $8.5bn. "Weak German industrial orders suggests it’s not a one-way ticket in Europe — there’s been a lot of bullishness around European equities lately but maybe this is a sign it’s not all positive. Deutsche Bank is not helping either," said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital. British temporary power provider Aggreko slumped almost 11% and French retailer Casino Guichard fell 5% after publishing their results. German industrial orders slumped 7.4% in January, the biggest fall since January 2009 and nearly three times as steep as the 2.5% fall expected by economists. US futures pointed to a slightly lower open on Wall Street, cooling from last week’s record highs as investors prepare for an all-but-certain interest rate increase next week. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4%, and Japan’s Nikkei closed down 0.2%. Dollar up In currencies, the dollar inched higher against a basket of trade-weighted peers. The dollar index rose 0.1% to 101.73, mirroring Monday’s slender gain. A rate increase from the Federal Reserve next week is virtually fully priced into financial markets, so the dollar and US bond yields might be vulnerable to a correction lower. But investors saw enough room to push the greenback and yields higher on Tuesday, lifting the 10-year yield for the fifth consecutive day back above 2.50% and the two-year yield up a basis point to 1.32%. Sterling was the biggest mover on major forex markets, falling almost 0.3% against the dollar to a seven-week low of $1.2202. Britain’s House of Lords on Tuesday will try to force the government to give legislators a greater say over the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU and final approval of an eventual deal with the block. Morgan Stanley analysts said on Tuesday that they expected the pound to snap back as high as $1.45 by the end of 2018. "Sterling looks increasingly cheap in a historical context and our forex strategists [have] recently turned more bullish on the currency, targeting $1.28 for year-end and $1.45 by the end of 2018," they wrote in a note on Tuesday. The euro was steady at $1.0575 and the dollar was flat against the yen at ¥113.90. In commodities, US oil rose 0.3% to $53.55 a barrel, following Monday’s 0.2% drop, and Brent crude also rose 0.3% to $56.17. Gold slipped 0.1% to $1,225/oz. Reuters
