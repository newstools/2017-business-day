The South African bond market turned positive at lunchtime on Friday as it caught up with a rand that was relatively stronger. The yield on the benchmark R186 was at 8.710%, from 8.745% on Thursday, as the rand recovered to session highs of R13.09 to the dollar from lows of nearly 13.18. The local markets have been largely inconsistent this week, with speculation of an imminent increase in interest rates in the US tempering positive sentiment that flowed from improving economic data. Earlier this week, several high-ranking US Federal Reserve officials hinted that a rate increase was on the cards for March, prompting the markets to price in the likely outcome. It is against this background that speeches from Fed chair Janet Yellen and other Fed officials would be closely watched later on Friday. "Yellenâ€™s speech on the economic outlook could cause a large reaction if she is slightly dovish on the possibility of a hike, especially in thin trading on Friday evening," Rand Merchant Bank analyst Michelle Wohlberg said. Higher US rates make the dollar more appealing as they boost returns on assets denominated in the currency. The yield on the US 10-year bond hit 2.50%, the highest since February 14.
