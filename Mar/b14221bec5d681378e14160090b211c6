Premier of the Western Cape and former DA leader Helen Zille says she is prepared to appear before the party’s federal legal commission following her controversial comments on social media in which she seemed to extol colonialism. "I’m quite happy to appear before the federal legal commission. We have the rule of law and it applies equally to everyone in the DA," she said on Thursday. Zille sparked anger on Twitter on Thursday with comments. "For those claiming legacy of colonialism was only negative‚ think of our independent judiciary‚ transport infrastructure‚ piped water etc‚" she tweeted. Her comments caused an uproar on social media, forcing her successor, Mmusi Maimane, to refer the matter to the party’s federal legal commission. "We received a number of complaints and I find [Zille’s tweet] indefensible," he said. DA spokeswoman Phumzile van Damme said Zille had issued an "unreserved apology". Zille sent a second tweet, after facing the wrath of those on the social networking site, saying: "Getting onto an aeroplane now and won’t get onto the wi-fi so that I can cut off those who think EVERY aspect of colonial legacy was bad."
