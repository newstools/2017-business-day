Old Mutual halved what it terms its "second interim dividend" (usually called a final dividend), reducing its total dividend for 2016 by nearly a third.The insurance group declared a 3.39p dividend for the second half of its financial year to end-December, down 46% from the 6.25p paid in the second half of 2015. This took the total dividend for 2016 to 6.06p, 32% lower than the 8.9p paid in 2015.Announcements in Thursday morning&rsquo;s final results statement included that the role of former finance minister Trevor Manuel, who has chaired Old Mutual&rsquo;s South African operations since May 2016, has been expanded to chair Old Mutual Emerging Markets (OMEM).The group appointed Glyn Jones as chair of its UK business, Old Mutual Wealth, along with five new nonexecutive directors. This is presumably ahead of the expected spinning-off of Old Mutual Wealth into a separately listed company.Old Mutual head hunted former Liberty CEO Bruce Hemphill in November 2015, appointing him as CEO with the task of stripping the group down to OMEM.On Thursday, the insurance group reported that its aftertax profit declined 8.6% to &pound;845m while operating profit remained flat at &pound;1.8bn.Although Old Mutual&rsquo;s breakup plan includes divesting itself of Nedbank, the results statement showed it was heavily reliant on its 55%-owned bank for its group operating profit.Nedbank grew its profit contribution by 6% to &pound;799m, contributing 44% of the insurance group&rsquo;s &pound;1.8bn operating profit.OMEM grew its contribution less than 1% to &pound;619m, accounting for 34% of the total.Its UK division, Old Mutual Wealth, suffered a 15% decline in operating profit to &pound;260m, contributing 14% of the total.Institutional Asset Management suffered a 5% decline in operating profit to &pound;141m, accounting for 8% of the group&rsquo;s total.Highlights of 2016 included materially reducing the group&rsquo;s debt by &pound;385m, thereby reducing annual finance costs by &pound;21m for the financial year underway, Hemphill said.It reduced its stake in US subsidiary Old Mutual Asset Management (OMAM) to 51%, raising net proceeds of &pound;230m. It gained a further &pound;230m by selling Old Mutual Wealth Italy."We are delivering on our promises: we sold down part of our stake in OM Asset Management, materially reduced our debt, cut head-office costs and made significant strides in preparing the businesses for independence," Hemphill"While the macroeconomic conditions have been tough in 2016, our businesses have performed resiliently, with a stronger performance in the second half, demonstrating the underlying strengths of the franchises. We expect 2017 to be a year characterised by the hard work required to get the businesses ready for separation in 2018. We are confident that the managed separation will unlock and deliver long-term shareholder value."
