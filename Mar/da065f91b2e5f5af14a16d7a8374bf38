The Constitutional Court has ordered the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) to explain to the court when it realised it would not be able to pay social grants itself after March 31. ENCA reporter Annika Larsen posted the court order on her Twitter account on Wednesday morning. The court wants to know from Sassa: • who determined that Sassa would not be in a position to pay grants; the date when that person became aware of this; • the “exact dates” when that person realised Sassa would not meet the deadlines set for it by the court; • the reason the court was not immediately informed; and • whether and when Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini was informed that Sassa would not be able to take over grant payments. The court also wants to know whether Sassa has entered a new contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), and if so, to give full details of the deal. Serge Belamant, CEO of CPS parent group Net1, says terms have been agreed for CPS to continue paying grants from April 1, but Dlamini has said no formal deal has been struck. The court wants Sassa to address the matter of Constitutional Court oversight of grant payments, and to explain its objections, if it has any. It has set a deadline of March 13 for Sassa to provide this information and file accompanying affidavits. Sassa had filed an urgent application to the Constitutional Court earlier this month, seeking to be allowed to extend the CPS contract - which the court had in 2014 declared invalid, but which was allowed to remain in place to ensure grant recipients were paid. But on March 3, Sassa withdrew its court application.
