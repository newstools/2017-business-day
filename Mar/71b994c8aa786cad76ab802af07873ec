Nevertheless, an increase in the confidence index could be underpinned by perceptions that the political situation has quietened down compared to the end of 2015 and during 2016. Moreover, growth prospects, following stagnation in 2016, for SA have improved slightly; the budget maintained the commitment to fiscal consolidation and SA&rsquo;s investment-grade sovereign credit rating was affirmed in December," Kaplan wrote.Statistics SA is scheduled to release January&rsquo;s retail trade sales data at 1pm on Wednesday.Kaplan expects SA&rsquo;s annual retail sales growth to improve to 1.7% in January from 0.9% in December."Retail sales growth is likely to remain muted for as long as consumer confidence is persistently depressed and if credit extension rates remain weak. Slowing inflation should provide some relief to the household financial position in 2017, although a meaningful rebound in consumer spending could be restricted by the tax increases announced in the 2017 budget," Kaplan said.Computer group EOH said on February 15 it expected to report on Wednesday interim headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the six months to end-January grew by between 20% and 25%.
