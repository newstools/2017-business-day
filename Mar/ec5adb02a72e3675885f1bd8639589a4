South African Social Security Agency CEO Thokozane Magwaza returned to work on Monday, despite speculation over the past two weeks that he had been suspended. Department of Social Development spokeswoman Lumka Oliphant confirmed that he had returned to work. Magwaza was booked off work at the end of February, when Sassa was scheduled to appear before Parliament’s standing committee on public accounts. At the time Thamo Mzobe was appointed as acting CEO while Magwaza was on sick leave, once again fuelling speculation that he had been suspended. Magwaza and the department denied this at the time. On Thursday last week, Sassa had to appoint its second acting CEO, after Mzobe had been hospitalised. Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini’s adviser, Wiseman Magasela, was appointed acting CE. Magasela is the department’s deputy director-general for research and policy development, seconded to the position of adviser to the minister. At the time, Sassa said Magasela was appointed until Magwaza returned.
