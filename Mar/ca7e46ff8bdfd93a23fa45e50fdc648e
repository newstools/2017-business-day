Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown insisted on Wednesday that she did not sit twiddling her thumbs while Rome burnt with regards to conflicts of interest by board members of state-owned enterprises. The minister was questioned by members of Parliament’s public enterprises committee about by former public protector Thuli Madonsela’s state of capture report, which alleged conflicts of interest by the Eskom board. Brown said she wrote to board members of state-owned enterprises four times a year asking for a declaration of conflicts of interest and informing them that where there were conflicts they should resign. She said at about the same time as she sent such a letter four members of boards of state-owned enterprises resigned. Brown said she could not comment on the state of capture report as there might be an inquiry into it later.
