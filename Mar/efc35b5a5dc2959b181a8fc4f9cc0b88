President Jacob Zuma's office has confirmed that he &ldquo;will not attend the funeral and memorial service in compliance with the wishes of the family&rdquo;.And he has postponed the start of Wednesday's Cabinet meeting &ldquo;to enable members to attend the funeral&rdquo;.The funeral takes place as rumours swirl that Zuma will axe Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, after canning investor roadshows the two were to lead to the UK and the US.In a statement issued on Wednesday morning, Zuma said: The nation has lost one of its valuable and most respected freedom fighters, Isithwalandwe, Mr Ahmed Mohamed Kathrada, one of the accused of the famous Rivonia Treason Trial. The passing of Mr Kathrada is a monumental loss not only to his family but to all South Africans as he was one of the fearless and dedicated architects of the free and democratic SA. He sacrificed his personal freedom and persevered through hardships for the liberation of all SA and to create a democratic, non-racial, peaceful and prosperous SA. Mr Kathrada will be remembered for his discipline and the fearless leadership that he displayed which led to his arrest in 1963 in Rivonia, near Johannesburg. Zuma said Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will lead the government delegation to the funeral and memorial service.Kathrada was a strident critic of Zuma and last year wrote an open letter calling on the president to resign after the Constitutional Court found that Zuma had violated the Constitution.Zuma on Tuesday declared a special official funeral for Kathrada and directed that flags be flown at half-mast until the evening of the memorial service.With TMG Digital
