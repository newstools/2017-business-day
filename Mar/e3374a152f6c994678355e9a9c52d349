Dunedin Kagiso Rabada is recovering from a stomach bug but he seems in better shape than Ross Taylor after two days of the first Test at University Oval. The team management said on Thursday after stumps, which New Zealand reached on 177/3 in reply to SA’s first innings of 308‚ that Rabada had taken ill on Wednesday afternoon but had since "stopped vomiting". Despite his condition the fast bowler has pulled his weight‚ batting for 20 minutes and bowling 14 overs. Taylor would seem to be much worse off. He retired hurt with an injured calf after facing 20 balls and limped off the field. The stalwart of 81 Tests could be in danger of missing the rest of the series. Morné Morkel made a satisfactory return from a lingering back problem in 10 overs in which he went wicketless but impressed SA’s bowling coach‚ Charl Langeveldt. "His pace was up‚ he bowled a good number of overs‚ he bowled really well and he got the ball in good areas‚" Langeveldt said. Crucially, Morkel "was bowling at 100%". Kane Williamson will resume on Friday on 78 not out‚ and Langeveldt knows his wicket is precious. "We have to box smart and try and contain Kane Williamson. He’s the key‚" Langeveldt said. "I’m not sure whether Ross Taylor is going to come back but he’s a good batsman and they’ve got a few all-rounders coming in. So we still have to bowl well to get them out. "[On Friday] morning I feel we’ll have that opportunity." SA’s most dangerous bowler could be Vernon Philander‚ whose knack for finding assistance in any surface looms as an important factor. "I think Kane’s on top at the moment‚ but Vern is a strong character‚" Langeveldt said. "He will come back strong [on Friday] morning — I know him to be like that. "He bowls good areas‚ so he’s going to ask questions." The trick for SA is to make sure New Zealand don’t have too many answers. TMG Digital
