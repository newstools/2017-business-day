Los Angeles &mdash; SA strengthened their grip on the World Rugby Sevens Series, notching their fourth win of the season on Sunday with a 19-12 triumph over Fiji in Las Vegas.With tries from Chris Dry, Cecil Afrika and Rosko Specman, SA denied Fiji a third straight Las Vegas crown.Fiji, the Olympic champions, remain in search of a first victory of the season, although they moved into second place in the standings led by SA on 107 points.Fiji leapfrogged England to stand second on 83 points, England dropping to third on 81 as the series heads to Vancouver next weekend.This time around, SA powered to the title without Seabelo Senatla, crowned player of the final in both Wellington and Sydney before leaving the Blitzboks for Super Rugby duty.Man of the match honours on Sunday went to Specman, who said he owed a debt to his team-mates &mdash; and offered a shout-out to Senatla."It feels fantastic to win, but the team is doing the hard work," he said."I think maybe it&rsquo;s lucky number 11. I am wearing the shirt from Seabelo, maybe it is giving me that little bit of extra speed!"SA captain Philip Snyman said the victory at blustery Sam Boyd Stadium was the most difficult of the season against a Fiji side out to avenge defeats in Dubai and Wellington."Fiji wanted to get one back over us but credit to the boys," he said. "Now we go to cooler conditions in Vancouver and hopefully we can continue with the form we are in."Both finalists had to fight back for semifinal wins.Fiji were 14 points down in the first half against New Zealand but roared back with 19 unanswered points for a 19-14 triumph.SA were in an early 12-0 hole against the US but rallied to beat the hosts 20-17.The US recovered from that disappointment to beat New Zealand 19-15 for third place, reaching the podium for the first time in their home tournament.AFP
