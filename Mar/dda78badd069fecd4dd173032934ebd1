A motion was presented to Parliament on Wednesday condemning the incarceration of Emlyn Culverwell and his fiancée‚ who are being held in a United Arab Emirates (UAE) prison for pregnancy out of wedlock. The motion was presented by DA MP and deputy shadow environmental minister Terri Stander. Emlyn’s mom‚ Linda Culverwell‚ and family have been fighting for the release of the couple for the past six weeks. Due to the exposure that the story has generated nationwide‚ a Durban woman made contact with Linda Culverwell and revealed that her daughter was in a similar situation and currently locked up with Iryna Nohai in the prison cell. Through this call‚ Linda Culverwell learnt that Nohai was still pregnant. Linda Culverwell said she had received an overwhelming amount of support. "I never dreamt so many people would care. I have been on the phone non-stop. I’m tired‚ but it’s a good tired‚" she said. Linda Culverwell was also offered a plane ticket by an employee at Yas Waterworld to Abu Dhabi so she could visit Emlyn‚ and hopefully Nohai. Only family members who share the same family name are allowed to visit detainees. Linda Culverwell also learnt that Emlyn and Nohai had not spoken to each other and attempts to send money for phone calls had been unsuccessful. TMG/Talk of the Town
