The Reserve Bank monetary policy committee is likely to maintain the current repo rate on Thursday mainly because of retreating inflation, a smaller trade deficit and stronger rand."With inflation at 6.3 year on year and falling, the bank will have to aggressively cut its inflation forecast for this year, which is currently at 6.4%," FNB economist Mamello Matikinca said. "Depending on just how much [the committee] revise their inflation number by, the meeting may well be used to signal the end of the hiking cycle and a possibility of a rate cut later this year."Producer price inflation (PPI), which Statistics SA will publish on Thursday, will also have a bearing. The February figures are expected to reveal a meaningful moderation. In January PPI slowed to 5.9% as agriculture and food producer inflation was less aggressive.Another body of research that will also influence the Reserve Bank s inflation outlook, is the inflation expectations survey that the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University will publish on Thursday.The monetary policy committee has held the interest rate steady at 7% since a year ago in spite of monetary policy tightening resuming in the US in December 2016 with expectations for further rate hikes in 2017. This would lure higher yield seeking investors from riskier emerging markets."Expect a more dovish rhetoric [from the Reserve Bank] to be tempered with warnings of continued global political uncertainty and the risk of the US Federal Reserve having to act more decisively than the market is pricing should inflation begin to lift uncomfortably," said Matikinca.The week begins with the publication of tourism and migration figures for January 2017 on Monday and on the same day Stats SA will release February statistics on liquidations and insolvencies.Also on Monday, the Bureau for Economic Research will publish its manufacturing survey. Similar to the purchasing managers index published at the beginning of each month, the survey is a deeper analysis of trends in the industry that is beginning to reflect a marginal recovery as exports and global demand lift after a dismal 2016.On Tuesday, the bureau will release the Civil Construction Confidence index, which will reflect on the first quarter of 2017. This is expected to show that confidence has improved among residential subcontractors.Trade data for February will be published on Friday. A slight improvement in the trade balance is expected from a wider-than-anticipated deficit of R10.8bn in January.The trajectory of private credit extension in February will round off the main economic data expected next week. Macquarie Securities economist Elna Moolman forecasts a moderation in take-up of debt by the private sector to 4.7% in February year on year from 5.6% in January.
