The law did not allow banks to close accounts simply on the basis of suspicions, Reserve Bank deputy governor Kuben Naidoo stressed in Parliament on Wednesday. He was replying to a question by DA finance spokesman David Maynier about why it had taken Absa so long to close the accounts of the Gupta-owned companies. Maynier noted that Absa had decided to terminate the banker-client relationship with the Gupta-owned Oakbay companies and related parties on November 18 2014 but only formally closed the accounts on February 16 2016. The exchange took place during public hearings by Parliament’s finance and trade and industry committees on transformation of the financial services sector. Naidoo said it was correct that banks took a long time to close accounts as this should be a last resort, after other attempts to manage the risk had been exhausted through enhanced vigilance and closer scrutiny. Bank accounts could not be closed simply on the basis of suspicions — the bar had to be much higher than that, Naidoo said. The closure of bank accounts should not be standard practice, he emphasised. Naidoo said he could not publicly discuss the closure of accounts as this was for the bank and account holder to disclose. Nor could the bank publicly discuss any investigation into any bank accounts.
