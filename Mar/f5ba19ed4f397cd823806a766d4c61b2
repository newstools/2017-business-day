Sydney — Three-time world surfing champion Mick Fanning announced on Tuesday that he would return to the world tour full-time in 2017 for the first time since being attacked by a shark. The Australian competed sporadically in 2016 after a tumultuous year in which he survived a shark attack in SA and dealt with his brother’s death and a marriage break-up. "It was nice to have 2016 off somewhat and decompress but I’m excited to put the singlet on again," Fanning said. The 35-year-old said 2015 had been "a tough year". "A lot happened to me on camera and in my personal life. I just felt exhausted by the end of it," he said. Fanning made global headlines when he fought off a great white shark on live television during the J-Bay Open. He survived the terrifying ordeal unscathed but it rattled him. He overcame his fears and got back in the water to stay in the title race, pushing it to the season-ending Pipe Masters in Hawaii, where he learnt that his brother Peter had died suddenly as he prepared to surf for a fourth world crown. Fanning, who also separated from his wife that year, narrowly missed out to Brazilian Adriano de Souza and decided to take a sabbatical. But he said he was again ready to test himself against the world’s best. The World Surf League championship gets under way later in March at Snapper Rocks on the Gold Coast in Australia. It will also take in events in Brazil, Fiji, SA, Tahiti, California, France, Portugal and Hawaii. AFP
