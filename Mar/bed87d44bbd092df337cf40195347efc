Tributes are pouring in for ANC stalwart Ahmed Kathrada&sbquo; who died in the early hours of Tuesday.Kathrada passed away at about 4am on Tuesday in a Johannesburg hospital after suffering complications from a medical procedure to deal with clotting on the brain. His condition had severely deteriorated in the hours leading up to his death.The Nelson Mandela Foundation mourned the death of the ANC stalwart&sbquo; while politicians past and present took to Twitter to salute Kathrada&sbquo; including Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula and Mmusi Maimane.&ldquo;Mr K&sbquo; as he was affectionately known at the Foundation&sbquo; played a pivotal role both in the establishment of the organisation in 1999 as Mr Mandela&rsquo;s post-presidential office and in its later growth as an NGO promoting social justice through dialogue and memory work. He was our wise counsellor&sbquo; our stern critic&sbquo; our best friend&sbquo;&rdquo; the foundation said in a statement.&ldquo;But we will remember him&sbquo; fundamentally&sbquo; as the embodiment of promise for a liberatory future. He worked for that future to the end. He walked the walk. He never wavered.&ldquo;We miss him already&sbquo; and always will. We thank his beloved Barbara and everyone else who gave him the strength he needed always to go the extra mile.&rdquo;Denis Goldberg&sbquo; who was one of the Rivonia treason trialists alongside Kathrada&sbquo; &ldquo;Uncle Kathy&rdquo; the most.Speaking to Radio 702 on Tuesday morning&sbquo; just hours after Kathrada&rsquo;s passing&sbquo; a clearly emotional Goldberg said:&ldquo;We were arrested together&sbquo; went through the Rivonia [treason] trial together and we went through facing the gallows together&sbquo; absolutely certain we were going to be hanged.Goldberg&sbquo; who was sentenced to prison in Pretoria while Kathrada went to Robben Island because of the apartheid government&rsquo;s racist policies&sbquo; recalled how Kathrada last year called on President Jacob Zuma to resign.&ldquo;I support him on that. There&rsquo;s a violation of our Constitution going on constantly&sbquo; and that Constitution is what stands between us and chaos. We need to be out in the streets protesting the violation of the very principles we fought for &mdash; the theft of state assets&sbquo; the theft of the values we stood for.&ldquo;We fought apartheid because the resources and valuable minerals and lives of our people were stolen by apartheid&sbquo; and now we&rsquo;re thieving the very valuable things that our Constitution is supposed to defend &mdash; in the name of crookery and thuggery.&rdquo;The Thabo Mbeki Foundation (TMF) paid tribute to Kathrada for his contribution to the struggle against apartheid."Comrade Kathy&sbquo; as he was fondly known&sbquo; dedicated all his adult life to the struggle against apartheid and the construction of a nonracial&sbquo; nonsexist and democratic SA. For this principled stand&sbquo; he&sbquo; together with his fellow comrades&sbquo; spent more than a quarter of a century on Robben Island&sbquo;" the foundation said in a statement."It is often said of the passing of the heroic that it is the &lsquo;end of an era&rsquo;. While this certainly applies to SA in many respects&sbquo; the TMF believes that to the extent that the ideals for which Comrade Kathy fought are yet to be realised&sbquo; we must do everything to ensure that the values which inspired him to battle germinate a million times over and produce more of his calibre who will&sbquo; instead of submitting&sbquo; vigorously prosecute the struggle for a SA that truly belongs to all who live in it."Our thoughts and prayers go to Comrade Kathy&rsquo;s partner Comrade Barbara Hogan&sbquo; his wider family of comrades and friends."DA leader Mmusi Maimane said Kathrada fought relentlessly for the freedoms South Africans share today.Maimane said: "Uncle Kathy&sbquo; as he was affectionately known&sbquo; embodied a profound sense of compassion&sbquo; and an unwavering commitment to true justice."As leader at the forefront of the struggle for liberation&sbquo; Kathrada relentlessly fought for the freedoms we all cherish today."He recalled a conversation with Kathrada at Mandela&rsquo;s funeral."He told me of the years on Robben Island where he&sbquo; along with the likes of Mandela&sbquo; [Walter] Sisulu and [Oliver] Tambo&sbquo; never heard or saw the presence of children. He shared with me that for him freedom meant hearing the voices of children&sbquo; indicating his sincere compassion&sbquo; as well as his commitment to the future of our beautiful country&sbquo;" said Maimane.Human rights group Section 27 said: And while Ahmed Kathrada s long journey has come to an end. As a nation ours has just begun we owe to it Ahmed Kathrada to live in the just and equal world they imagined and fought for we owe it to Ahmed Kathrada to protect the very principals of freedom that he worked so tirelessly to realise. The greatest honour to Kathy is to defend everything we have fought for with everything we have got. That fight is now. The South African Jewish Board of Deputies said it joins all South African in mourning the loss of Ahmed Kathrada one of the founding fathers of our democracy and anti-Apartheid stalwart. The heroism and self-sacrifice that he showed in taking a stand against injustice will be his enduring legacy. Our condolences go to his family and friends.
