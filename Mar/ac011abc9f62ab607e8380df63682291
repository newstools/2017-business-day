Addis Ababa — Danny Jordaan won his quest for a place on the Confederation of African Football’s (Caf) executive committee after a convincing win, as he emerged as one of the kingmakers on a day of upset results at the elections here. The South African Football Association (Safa) president will serve for four years as one of the southern African members. But he can now be considered as a potential future candidate for the leadership of Caf after receiving 35 votes to win the poll of three who were chasing two southern African places in the 15-man exco. Rui Almeida da Costa of Angola was also elected with 25 votes‚ one more than Frans Mbidi of Namibia, while Suketu Patel of the Seychelles pulled out before the vote. "After a long time‚" said a smiling Jordaan as he was congratulated by fellow South Africans Irvin Khoza‚ Raymond Hack and Molefi Oliphant after the vote. Jordaan had failed four years ago in his bid to get onto the cabinet of African football’s governing body when he was upset by Ahmad Ahmad of Madagascar. Ahmad is the new leader of African football after ousting long-serving Caf president Issa Hayatou in a stunning upset at the organisation’s congress on Thursday. Jordaan had been one of Ahmad’s primary backers as SA joined the rebels in the build-up to Thursday’s vote. For the past few years, Jordaan has been one of Hayatou’s special advisers, but the relationship changed when Hayatou refused to back Jordaan in the campaign. Jordaan is among a sweep of new faces on the exco after Hayatou’s loyalists were swept from power in dramatic blood-letting during the much anticipated elections. Fifa president Gianni Infantino was seen as a stronginfluence as he had made no bones about his support for change. Hayatou had been expected to have a tough challenge, but few foresaw the decisive nature of the win for Ahmad‚ who now leads an organisation with an increasingly new generation of football association presidents.
