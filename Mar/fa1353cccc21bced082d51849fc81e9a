The South African bond market was firmer in midday trade on Wednesday on positive inflationary and current account data. The local market followed a stronger rand, with the rand reaching R12.62/$ in intraday trade from R12.6716. The current account deficit narrowed to 1.7% of GDP in the fourth quarter, from 3.8% in the third, the best level in six years. The consumer price index (CPI) dropped to 6.3% in February from 6.6% in January, the lowest rate in over a year, raising hopes that the Reserve Bank might reduce interest rates toward the end of the year. At 11.36am the yield on the benchmark R186 was at 8.40% from 8.44%. The yield on the R207 was at 7.43% from 7.49%. The rand was at R12.6542 against the dollar from R12.6716. "We think that headline inflation would fall within the Bank’s 3%-6% target range in the second quarter," said Capital Economics analyst William Jackson. That could provide scope for the Reserve Bank to lower rates, he said. Earlier some analysts were sceptical about if the firmer rand could continue, saying the local currency was stretched at present levels. The rand has confounded the sceptics so far this year, gaining 7.85% against the dollar. US treasuries were weaker on the softer dollar as the market continued to react to last week’s mildly dovish outlook from the US Federal Reserve. The yield on the US 10-year bond was at 2.4007% from 2.4168%.
