ANC stalwarts said the late-night Cabinet reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma could be seen as a factional move to undermine attempts to confront the "crisis" in the country. "Given the way the decision was apparently taken and the lack of consultation also shows a marginalisation of the ANC by the president," the stalwarts said in a statement on Friday. They said ministers had to be appointed because of their skills. "Decisions must be made on merit and not self-interest, especially within a government that is of the ANC, with its long history of collective responsibility and consultation." The stalwarts have for some time been expressing concern about the direction in which the ANC and the country have been heading. They were also trying to convince the ANC to hold a national consultative conference ahead of its June policy conference and December elective conference. Zuma announced a Cabinet reshuffle in the early hours of Friday morning in which he sacked Pravin Gordhan as finance minister and Mcebisi Jonas as deputy finance minister. Gordhan was replaced by former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba. Zuma reshuffled 10 ministers and 10 deputies. The stalwarts said there were serious question marks over the criteria used for the recent reshuffle. The veterans said they would consult widely before making further comments. "As stalwarts we cannot and will not become involved in factional fights. "Leadership must be seen serving the interests of the people without thought of self-interest. As stalwarts we cannot allow the ANC to become marginal to the affairs of the country," they said.
