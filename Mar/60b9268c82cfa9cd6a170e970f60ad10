The electronic timing system that failed in Wayde van Niekerk’s 100m race in Bloemfontein on Wednesday was less than a year old‚ athletics officials say. Van Niekerk‚ the Olympic and world 400m champion‚ was beaten into second place by 18-year-old Gift Leotlela in the main 100m race of the Athletics SA Speed Series meet. Organisers had to resort to hand times after the failure of the electronic apparatus. A Free State Athletics official said the new system was bought less than a year ago‚ after the 2016 provincial championships in which Van Niekerk ran 9.98sec in the 100m. That feat made him the first man in history to break the three sprint barriers — 10sec in the 100m‚ 20sec in the 200m and 44sec in the 400m. Athletics SA president Aleck Skhosana said the transponder had failed. "It is something you connect to the gun‚ so when you shoot‚ the gun must hit the transponder and in that particular race the transponder did not [fire]. "Why — because it’s a new system — we don’t know. We’ll have to find out from the company [LG]‚" he added. "We have two systems connected in case [one] fails but if the failure is in the transponder you have a problem." Leotlela was given a hand time of 10.0‚ while Van Niekerk and third-placed Emile Erasmus were 10.1. But the electronic timing produced some eyebrow-raising results. Ruan de Vries surprised himself by breaking the African 110m hurdles record by a hundredth of a second when he was clocked at 13.23sec‚ a huge improvement on his previous 13.59 best from 2013. The previous mark of 13.24 was set by Lehann Fourie in a Diamond League race a month after he competed in the final of the 2012 London Olympics. De Vries‚ 31‚ and the next two finishers‚ Junior Mkhatini and Muntingh Hamman‚ were all inside the 13.48 qualifying standard for the world championships in London in August. None of the trio has competed at a senior world championships before. Mkhatini and Hamman‚ both 27‚ had both seldom dipped below 14sec‚ with personal bests of 13.96 and 13.90‚ but on Wednesday they clocked 13.28 and 13.41. In the 100m B race‚ winner Leroux van Tonder clocked 10.09 — a huge improvement on his 10.51 previous best — and even the next two finishers in 10.12 and 10.15 made significant improvements on their personal bests‚ neither having been quicker than 10.40. The first two were also inside the world championship qualifying standard‚ although they would have to be among the country’s top three by the end of the window period to be eligible for selection. Akani Simbine is fastest so far this season with his 9.93 in Pretoria at the weekend‚ but 28-year-old Van Tonder’s 10.09 on Wednesday could potentially be good enough for the top three. Skhosana said he had been given no reason to doubt Wednesday’s times. "The times were fine‚ I was told by the technical people. "Remember‚ sprints in this country have evolved in an unbelievable way. Times have evolved." TMG Digital
