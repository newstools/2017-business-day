Gupta-linked Vardospan says it is in for the long haul despite the High Court in Pretoria dismissing the urgency of its court bid to fast-track its acquisition of Habib Bank. Friday’s ruling meant the merits of the application had not been determined and remained alive, the company said. “The application can now be pursued in the ordinary course and not as an urgent application. “The parties to the sale of shares agreement are still at liberty to agree and extend the ‘long stop date’ of the sale of shares agreement beyond March 31 2017,” Vardospan said. However, the Reserve Bank and the finance minister were still required to take a decision in the applications for permission. The Reserve Bank and former finance minister Pravin Gordhan were respondents in the matter. Gordhan was removed as minister in a late-night Cabinet reshuffle. Former home affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, who has replaced Gordhan, will now have to decide whether to approve the acquisition. Vardospan had approached the High Court on an urgent basis earlier this week in a bid to force the registrar to make a determination on its application by Friday. If the application is approved, Vardospan will hold a major stake in Habib Bank. The Reserve Bank, the registrar of banks and Gordhan had asked the court to dismiss the urgent application. It is understood that more than half of the bank accounts of Gupta-related entities have been closed in recent weeks by their last remaining bankers, the Bank of Baroda, with the process continuing. However, Oakbay Investments, the Gupta holding company in SA, has denied this.
