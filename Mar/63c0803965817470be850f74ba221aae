Banking group FirstRand on Thursday reported a 7% rise in normalised headline earnings to R11.64bn in the six months to end-December from the year-earlier period. "The group continued its delivery of real growth in earnings and premium returns off a long track record of outperformance," CE Johan Burger said in a statement. "Normalised earnings growth of 7% and an ROE [return on equity] of 22.9% was driven by solid operational performances from our franchises and is a very satisfactory outcome given the level of ongoing investment in new growth initiatives." The group, which owns First National Bank (FNB), Rand Merchant Bank and WesBank, lifted interim divided 10% to R1.19. FNB, which represents FirstRand’s retail and commercial segments, grew normalised earnings 3% to R6.46bn, as net interest income grew 11%, boosted by growth in both advances (6%) and deposits (11%) and the positive endowment effect from the increase in the repurchase rate. Overall nonperforming loans (NPL) increased 7%, with retail NPLs increasing 20%, partly driven by tough credit environment in certain African territories, particularly Mozambique and Zambia. RMB, FirstRand’s corporate and investment bank, grew pretax profits 3% to R4.1bn. WesBank, the group’s vehicle and asset-based finance business, grew normalised earnings 9%. "WesBank’s performance is pleasing, particularly in its domestic businesses, which are operating in an environment characterised by constrained consumer disposable income and a challenging credit cycle."
