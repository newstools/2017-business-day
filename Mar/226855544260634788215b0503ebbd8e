Tokyo &mdash; Asian shares rose on Monday, taking their cue from gains on Wall Street after strong US job data, although the mood was cautious as oil prices plunged to three-and-a-half-month lows on fresh concern about oversupply.A confluence of major events this week including an expected interest rate increase by the US Federal Reserve, a potentially divisive election in the Netherlands and a Group of 20 (G-20) finance ministers&rsquo; meeting kept many investors on edge.MSCI&rsquo;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6%, led by gains in tech-heavy South Korean shares and Taiwanese shares.Japan&rsquo;s Nikkei edged 0.2% higher, with exporters&rsquo; shares buoyed by a weaker yen.Global stocks rose on Friday, with the MSCI&rsquo;s index of 46 markets gaining 0.5%, snapping six consecutive days of losses after the robust US jobs report.Strong US jobs data all but sealed the chance of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday."The markets are focusing on when the Fed will raise rates next time or the pace of its rate hike, so the tone of Fed chair Janet Yellen will be closely watched," said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.US interest rate futures are pricing in about a 50% chance of another rate increase in June. By the end of 2017, a total of nearly three increases were fully priced in, including the likely move in March.In a Reuters poll of primary dealers, 12 of the 23 dealers expected a rate increase to 1%-1.25% by the June 13-14 meeting, while 10 expected such a move by the Fed&rsquo;s September meeting.The 10-year US treasuries yield slipped slightly on Friday partly as markets had already expected strong payroll figures. Still, it last stood at 2.584%, not far from its two-year high of 2.641% touched on December 15.US junk bonds have also faltered, with high-yield bond exchange-traded fund (ETF) posting its biggest weekly loss in more than a year.Global bond prices also came under pressure following a report that some European Central Bank (ECB) policy makers had discussed the possibility of rate increases before the end of its quantitative easing (QE) programme.The 10-year German bund yield rose to 0.496% on Friday, near its one-year high of 0.498% hit in January.A break of those previous peaks in major bond yields could spark a fresh sell-off in global bond markets.The talk of ECB rate increase, even though it is still seen as a remote possibility, helped to lift the euro. The single currency traded at $1.0690, after hitting a one-month high of $1.06995 on Friday.On the other hand, worry about the European project could resurface if Wednesday&rsquo;s parliamentary election in the Netherlands will see the far-right gain more ground than expected. Polls suggest the far-right ticket will double its vote and its results could affect investors perceptions&rsquo; on upcoming elections in France and Germany later this year.The dollar slipped to &yen;114.85 from Friday&rsquo;s seven-week high of &yen;115.51 after US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Friday that Japan would be on high on the US priority list for trade agreements.Traders suspect Washington, keen to reduce its trade deficit, may put pressure on Japan not to cheapen the yen in upcoming bilateral economic talks."The G-20 will be an important event for the dollar," said Yoshinori Shigemi, Tokyo-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management."I had assumed, until last week, that the dollar would gain on a rise in US rates. But if the G-20 say something like they want to reduce trade imbalances, that could give rise to the speculation that they may not want a strong dollar," said Yoshinori Shigemi, Tokyo-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.G-20 finance ministers and central bankers will meet in Germany on March 17-18, their first meeting attended by representatives of the administration of US President Donald Trump.A draft communiqu&eacute; circulated last week showed they may no longer explicitly reject protectionism or competitive currency devaluations.Oil skidded to three-and-a-half-month lows after posting biggest three-day loss in a year by Friday on worry that Opec-led production cuts have not yet reduced a global glut of crude as US drillers kept adding rigs.US crude futures dropped 0.8% to $48.11 a barrel, having shed more than 11% so far in March.Reuters
