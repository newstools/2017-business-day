A group of ANC veterans have accused some within the party&rsquo;s leadership of not wanting to critically discuss the state of the party because it may threaten their own interests.This stalwarts and the ANC&rsquo;s national working committee held a meeting on Monday, where they were told that a separate national consultative conference would not be held.Late last year, the ANC national executive committee resolved that the June policy conference would be extended to include a consultative conference after a request from the veterans.However, the veterans have been pushing for a separate consultative conference to be held before the policy conference.The stalwarts on Friday expressed shock that certain national working committee members at the meeting claimed that the national executive committee had never taken the decision to hold the consultative conference."Those stalwarts who attended the meeting are left with the strong impression that there is neither a strong desire nor commitment on the part of some individuals within the leadership to seriously engage on the crisis facing the ANC through the holding of a national consultative conference," they said in a statement on Friday."These individuals will continue to work collectively to attempt to avoid any critical discussion that may threaten their interests, irrespective of the damage to the country and the ANC."The group said it was not new that there were people who joined the ANC for self-enrichment or abused their positions, and that in 2001, former president Nelson Mandela had warned about this."The stalwarts will continue to work to ensure that Mandela&rsquo;s legacy is not destroyed by those who continue to put self-interest before that of our citizens," the veterans said.
