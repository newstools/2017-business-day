The South African bond market was firmer at midday on Monday as traders focus the expected increase in US interest rates.The markets have priced in a more than 90% chance of a rate increase compared with the 40% chance at the beginning of last week.Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) analyst Deon Kohlmeyer said this could change quickly, if disappointing nonfarm payroll data were released on Friday. The US is expected to have created between 162,000 and 220,000 jobs in February.Dow Jones Newswires reported that the recent sell-off in US government bonds had taken a breather last Friday after Fed chair Janet Yellen suggested a March rate increase was likely but dismissed concern that the central bank was moving too slowly to tighten monetary policy.
