Cape Town — The Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) lobby group is concerned about future payment of social grants and "believes that the matter could have been handled and communicated differently" to avert panic among 17-million beneficiaries. There has been uncertainty for months about payment of R11bn in grants after the expiry on March 31 of the unlawful contract with Net1 subsidiary Cash Paymaster Services (CPS). There is outrage over the lack of plans for payments as the Department The Department of Social Development and the SA Security Agency (Sassa) had three years to prepare. At the eleventh hour agreement was reached for CPS to continue paying the grants for a further two years, but this has yet to be endorsed by Treasury. The PPF said on Monday that "it becomes a huge concern to the country as a whole when a situation arises where payment of such critical services is reported not to be guaranteed and or some kind of doubt, perceived or real, arises rightly or wrongly that such service maybe disrupted". PPF secretary-general Luther Lebelo said the PPF believed "a more integrated and sustainable method of this payment is urgently needed and as a result". Sassa was urged "to resolve this in a manner that will ensure the promotion of radical economic transformation through revival of rural and township economies, and bring back confidence in the government’s ability and capacity to deliver". "PPF intends calling a meeting with the leadership of Sassa to further understand its factual and material conditions, including assisting to find long-term solution to the issue," Lebelo said.
