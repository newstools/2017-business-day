This week on Editing Allowed Peter Bruce and the Times Media editors talk about the crisis playing out at the SA Social Security Agency and the implications of welfare payments aren’t paid next month. The ANC’s policy documents ahead of its mid-year policy conference are also up for discussion, particularly mooted changes to competition policy and land appropriation without compensation. In part two of the show, the panel discuss divisions within the ANC, President Jacob Zuma’s growing populist stance, the Commonwealth games flop and transformation in the banking sector. • Editing Allowed airs on Business Day TV channel 412
