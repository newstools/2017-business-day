The $1.2bn fine Chinese telecoms vendor ZTE received from the US government on Tuesday for supplying the Iranian government with eavesdropping technology depressed Asian markets on Wednesday.ZTE&rsquo;s huge fine may also knock MTN&rsquo;s share on Wednesday since it is not yet clear if US investigators will next turn their focus to the South African group&rsquo;s role in this drama.Four years ago, MTN became a suspect after one of ZTE&rsquo;s competitors, Huawei, told US investigators it never knowingly broke sanctions on Iran, but did so unwittingly by selling equipment to MTN, which passed it on to its joint venture with the Iranian government, Irancell.Allied Electronics Corporation (Altron) jumped 9.2% to R10.92 on Tuesday after issuing a trading statement saying it expected to report a return to profit for the year to end-February. Altron said it expected to report on May 11 headline earnings per share (HEPS) of at least 50c, a turnaround from the previous year&rsquo;s R1.45 headline loss per share.After the market closed on Tuesday, Altron announced MTN SA CEO Mteto Nyati would be replacing Robbie Venter as its CEO by July 1 at the latest.MTN issued a statement saying Nyati would be leaving on March 13, and would be replaced by its vice-president of the south and east Africa region, Godfrey Motsa.Ascendis Health said on February 23 it expected to report on Wednesday that HEPS for the six months to end-December declined by up to 18%.This was due to the acquisitive group increasing its shares in issue to 414-million from 270-million. Its headline earnings grew to between R166m and R178m from R131m, the trading update said.
