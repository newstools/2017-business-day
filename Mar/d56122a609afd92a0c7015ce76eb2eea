Andile Lungisa’s bid for the ANC’s top spot in Nelson Mandela Bay was dealt a blow as it emerged that the party’s national leaders would not — in line with the ANC’s constitution — allow him to contest the chairmanship this weekend. Lungisa‚ who has been campaigning furiously ahead of the regional conference set to start on Friday‚ is still a member of the ANC’s provincial executive committee (PEC) and is thus barred by the party’s constitution from serving on a lower structure. In a letter sent to all provincial structures across the country on Wednesday‚ ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe wrote that any attempt to resign from the PEC to be able to stand for a position at a regional conference should not be allowed. The letter read: "Any attempt to resign must not be allowed as it is opportunistic ... Any province having problems with this resolution must propose an amendment of the constitution in the national conference or at least raise the issue in the national executive committee."
