The rand was on a firmer footing on Monday morning, benefiting from a broad weakness in the dollar despite the robust US nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.The local currency hovered around R13.10 to the greenback, marking a significant recovery from Friday when it weakened to R13.33.The recovery in commodity prices, particularly platinum and gold, also helping the rand&rsquo;s fortunes. Both metals encountered a sharp sell-off last week.The gold price was back over the psychological level of $1,200/oz, having dropped 2.43% over the past week, the worst weekly drop since November.The expectation of an increase in US interest rates makes nonyielding gold a less attractive asset class.Standard Bank trader Warrick Butler said in a note that the dollar trade was overdone heading to into the report, which showed the economy created 235,000 jobs in February from an upwardly revised 238,000 in January."The headline [nonfarm payrolls] number beat expectations, however, the wage growth number came in a little behind expectations which is where much of the focus lies these days, given the feed-through into inflation," Butler said.At 9.17am&sbquo; the rand was at R13.1014 to the dollar from Friday&rsquo;s R13.1886&sbquo; R14.0282 to the euro from R14.1009 and R16.0176 to the pound from R16.0625.The euro was at $1.0708 from $1.0686.
