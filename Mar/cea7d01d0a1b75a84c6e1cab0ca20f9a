The DA and the ANC have two months to drum up support to take control of the Beaufort West council, also the oldest municipality in the country.The Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) has announced May 24 as the date for the by-election.Ward 7 in Beaufort West became vacant when DA mayor Koos Malooi abruptly resigned from his post in February&sbquo; amid rumours about leadership squabbles in his party.According to the IEC&sbquo; the ward has 4&sbquo;131 registered voters and just more than 50% of the voters turned up to vote for Malooi in 2016&rsquo;s local government elections.Currently&sbquo; Beaufort West municipality has a hung council.In last year&rsquo;s local government elections&sbquo; the DA and ANC won six seats each&sbquo; but the DA took power after it negotiated a coalition agreement with the Karoo Democratic Force.Should the ANC win the upcoming by-election&sbquo; it will assume power and may bring back controversial former mayor Truman Prince.Meanwhile&sbquo; in KwaZulu-Natal&sbquo; Nquthu Municipality will hold an election after the council was dissolved by KwaZulu-Natal co-operative governance and traditional affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube for failing to form a government."The by-elections will include all 17 ward and 16 PR (proportional representation) council seats. There are currently 76&sbquo;606 registered voters in the 116 voting districts in Nquthu&sbquo;" IEC spokesperson Kate Bapela said in a statement.In last year&rsquo;s municipal elections&sbquo; the IFP won 15 seats but could not form a government since it did not win a governing majority.The ANC had 14 seats&sbquo; while the National Freedom Party had two seats&sbquo; with the EFF and the DA winning one each.Politicking has prevented the formation of a government in the council since the result of the election.TMG Digital
