The department of social development on Sunday said there was no formal deal struck with Cash Payment Services (CPS) regarding the payment of social grants.This was despite the same department announcing on Friday that an agreement had been reached.South African Social Security Agency programme head Dumisile Ndlovu told journalists in Pretoria on Sunday that there was no deal formalised."There is no deal at hand."The department spent three-days this week negotiating with CPS.With less than a month to go until the contract with CPS expires, there was uncertainty about how more than 17-million social grants will be paid on April 1.Social development minister Bathabile Dlamini on Sunday, however, was adamant that grants would be paid next month."On April 1 Sassa begins a new era. As has been the case in the past no one will go unpaid," she said."We are focused on our mandate to deliver social assistance to the country&rsquo;s most vulnerable. We will work with all the key stakeholders."The minister said the ultimate goal was for Sassa to have its own integrated grant administration and payment process.The new payment plan would be implemented in four phases of which the first two had already been completed.The next phase included phasing out the current service provider, CPS.Dlamini said Sassa was planning to take over the system in April 2019.Sunday&rsquo;s press briefing quickly degenerated after Dlamini refused to answer questions from journalists about the resignation of the department&rsquo;s director general Zane Dangor and follow-up questions on the grant saga.Dlamini accused journalists of having an agenda."I don t want to respond to questions of people wanting to impose themselves on us. If people want to ask questions they can ask but the nuances and everything are not helping all of us," she said."We are here to explain to the nation about April 1. It should be clear from April 1 we are paying grants."Dangor resigned on Friday citing a breakdown between himself and Dlamini on the "management of the processes towards ensuring grants are paid".His departure came just four months since his appointment.Dlamini said Dangor s resignation would be handled internally.
