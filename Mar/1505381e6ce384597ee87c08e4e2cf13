London — British police said they had made two further significant arrests in the investigation of the attack on London’s parliament. They also gave the birth name of the man behind the assault as Adrian Russell Ajao. Britain’s top antiterrorism officer, Mark Rowley, said police had nine people in custody after the attack on Wednesday, which killed five people including the assailant. Police had said the man behind the attack was British-born Muslim convert Khalid Masood and that they were trying to establish whether others had directed him. One of the dozens of people injured in the attack, a 75-year-old man, died on Thursday night. His death brings the toll to four victims. Reuters
