The SABC has approached the high court to challenge the findings of the public protector&rsquo;s damning 2014 report, which led to Hlaudi Motsoeneng&rsquo;s fall from grace at the public broadcaster.This was confirmed by acting CEO James Aguma, who appeared in Parliament on Tuesday to defend the SABC&rsquo;s decision to sign new contracts despite the public broadcaster&rsquo;s board not being quorate.SABC officials were in Parliament to discuss the public broadcaster&rsquo;s 2015-16 annual report, which shows it recorded a R411m loss. Aguma said the delegation-of-authority framework allowed the public broadcaster&rsquo;s executives to conclude deals. But the board has no nonexecutive members after most resigned in 2016 following a breakdown in governance.Aguma denied wrongdoing, saying all decisions were legal.The portfolio committee on communications began deliberating on Tuesday about the names of candidates to serve on an interim board, which will have five members appointed for six months.A new permanent board will then be appointed.The interim board will be tasked with implementing some of the recommendations contained in the final report on the SABC, including conducting a review of suspect contracts.The ANC&rsquo;s preferred candidates include Rachel Kalidass, Krish Naidoo, Mathatha Tsedu, Febe Potgieter-Gqubule and Steve Motale. The DA&rsquo;s list includes former Sowetan editor Mpumelelo Mkhabela, Tanja Bosch and veteran journalist John Matisonn.The committee is to deliberate on the names in coming days before deciding on the final five.It has not indicated when it will appoint the interim board.
