Factory and farm gate inflation &mdash; which averaged 7% in 2016 due to a severe drought pushing up food prices &mdash; continued its deceleration in February, coming in at 5.6%. February&rsquo;s slowdown follows January&rsquo;s sharp drop to 5.9% from December&rsquo;s 7.1%. On Thursday Statistics SA reported that its producer price index (PPI) for February was 101 points. The index, which was set to 100 points in December 2016, was 0.6% higher than January&rsquo;s 100.4 points. Annual producer inflation peaked at 8.1% in February 2016. Thursday&rsquo;s data showed the highest inflation in February was for diesel, which was 23.1% more expensive than the same month in 2016. Petrol producer inflation was 9.8%. Overall food producer inflation was 9% in February. Dairy product inflation of 12.5% was the highest in the food category after sugar, with fruit and vegetable inflation third, at 11.7%. Sugar inflation abated to 14.7%. Oils and fats were 4.3% cheaper than in February 2016, according to Statistics SA&rsquo;s data. Deflation was also recorded for motor vehicle producers whose costs fell 4.2%. Vehicle parts and accessories were 5.7% cheaper. The slowdown in producer inflation is a good auger for consumer inflation, which is the main measure used by the Reserve Bank&rsquo;s monetary policy committee (MPC) to set interest rates. Reserve Bank governor and MPC chair Lesetja Kganyago was scheduled to announce March&rsquo;s vote at 3pm on Thursday. The central bank was expected to hold its repo rate at 7%. February&rsquo;s consumer price index (CPI) released on March 22 showed inflation decelerating to 6.3% from January&rsquo;s 6.6%.
