Bengaluru — Gold prices held steady on Tuesday as investors looked to see if US President Donald Trump would be able to enact promised tax cuts and infrastructure spending, with the dollar drifting from multimonth lows in the previous session. Spot gold was mostly unchanged at $1,253.66/oz at 2.38am GMT, after touching its highest in a month at $1,261.03 the day before. US gold futures inched down 0.2% to $1,253.7. "The markets are now starting to settle down as concerns around the implications of the failed [US] healthcare bill seem to have somewhat abated," said ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes. "We’re likely to see gold prices relatively steady for now until there is a little bit more clarity on Trump’s other policies, particularly over the tax bill." The dollar index was up 0.1% at 99.215. Asian stocks pulled ahead on Tuesday after Wall Street steadied and the dollar bounced from a four-month low. Trump suffered a major reversal when Republican leaders pulled legislation to overhaul the US healthcare system. The blow unnerved financial markets, heightening the concern about the chances of enacting tax reforms and big spending packages. The likely upper limit for gold prices would be at the $1,260 level over the next couple of weeks, Hynes said, adding that the precious metal would struggle to break through its 200-day average, now at $1,259.12/oz. Gold has already rallied sharply from its March 15 low following a less hawkish policy statement than expected from the US Federal Reserve, which dampened the expectation for near-term increases in US interest rates. Gold is highly sensitive to rising US interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced. Meanwhile, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, New York-listed SPDR Gold Shares, reported an inflow of 2.7 tonnes on Monday. Spot silver fell 0.4% to $17.99/oz. In the previous session, the metal touched its highest since March 2 at $18.12. Spot silver could break resistance at $18.46/oz and rise towards the next level of resistance at $19.34 over the next three months, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Platinum climbed 0.3% to $965.90/oz. On Monday, it marked its highest since March 6 at $982.60. Palladium slipped 0.7% to $787.55/oz. Reuters
