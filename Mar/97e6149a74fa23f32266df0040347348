Former Business Unity SA CEO Khanyisile Kweyama has been recommended by Parliament&rsquo;s portfolio committee to chair the interim board of the SABC.Media veteran Mathatha Tsedu was recommended as Kweyama&rsquo;s deputy.The recommendation brings the public service broadcaster one step closer to stability after the board collapsed last year during a parliamentary ad hoc committee probe into its fitness to hold office.The National Assembly will consider the recommendations on Wednesday afternoon.Krish Naidoo, Febe Potgieter-Gqubule and John Mattison are the other recommendations for the interim board.The recommendations are expected to be passed uncontested at the National Assembly.Media Monitoring Africa director William Bird said those put forward for the interim board had strong experience in various relevant disciplines, save for auditing and forensics."I think that, in general terms, those names should give the SABC a good fighting chance."There is a good balance of experience from media and human rights. Krish has recent experience in the broadcaster. Mathatha is strong on journalism, Febe has ... legislative know-how and Mattison is good in terms of academic memory," said Bird.However, Bird warned that political interference could arise, which might undermine the board&rsquo;s expertise and efforts in steering the public service broadcaster back to stability."The recommendations of the ad hoc committee and the freedom to implement them are where the interim board will either succeed or fail," Bird said."They must not be subjected to political interference. They must be allowed to go in and clean out the rotten wood as opposed to dead wood."According to recent reports, the SABC&rsquo;s December cash reserves were down to just R174m and the broadcaster would need R650m monthly to keep going.
