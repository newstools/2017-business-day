The rand plummeted 5% to R13.47/$ by 6.30am on Friday morning, from Thursday’s R12.79/$, following President Jacob Zuma’s midnight axing of Pravin Gordhan as finance minister. It now remains to be seen if the rand’s crash will be even worse than its 11% dive over the three days of Nenegate, when it fell from R14.49/$ on December 8 2015 before Zuma replaced Nhlanhla Nene with Des van Rooyen, to R16.04/$ three days later before Van Rooyen was replaced by Gordhan. The JSE’s banks are bound to go into free-fall when the stock exchange opens at 9am. On December 10 2015, the JSE’s banking index lost 13.5%. Zuma’s appointment of former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba as finance minister sent the rand 5% weaker against the euro to R14.39/à from R13.72/à and 5.3% weaker against the pound to R16.82/£ from R15.98/£. “The market will struggle to digest Gigaba. Someone who has been effective at home affairs but is clearly being put in a role to do a particular job by Zuma and viewed as loyal to Zuma,” Nomura emerging markets analyst Peter Attard Montalto said in an e-mail. “The market has been far too complacent that Zuma cannot remove Gordhan but he has now gone and done it and yet the market is still hanging onto the hope of a credible candidate, which has not come, with a complete clear-out at National Treasury. “This is a full whack Zuma-led reshuffle which will lead to multiple imminent downgrades where Zuma is confident he has the upper hand over weak internal ANC opposition.”
