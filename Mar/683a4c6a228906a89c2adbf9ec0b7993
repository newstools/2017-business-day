The High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday barred EFF leader Julius Malema from inciting illegal land grabs. The court granted an interdict to civil and business rights watchdogs AfriForum and AfriBusiness‚ which had submitted an application for such a ruling in November 2016. Malema‚ at the time‚ had made statements about occupying land in South Africa. AfriForum safety co-ordinator Tarien Cooks said in a statement on Tuesday that the EFF had been asked last year to stop inciting land grabs as it was a criminal offence. The EFF reacted to this request‚ sent by letter from AfriForum‚ by saying that land would be taken without compensation and redistributed. "AfriBusiness views private land ownership as one of the cornerstones of a flourishing economy that is based on the free market system. Any threat or undermining of private land ownership will deter local and international investors and lead to the flow of capital out of the country‚" said AfriBusiness law and policy analyst Armand Greyling. "Should Malema or a member of the EFF not adhere to this interdict‚ they will be charged with contempt of court‚" said Cooks. TMG Digital
