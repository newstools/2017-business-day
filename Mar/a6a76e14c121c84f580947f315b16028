Indian Wells — Nick Kyrgios ended Novak Djokovic’s 19-match winning run at Indian Wells, beating the Serb 6-4 7-6(3) to reach the BNP Paribas Open quarterfinals, while Roger Federer also advanced with a straight sets win over Rafa Nadal. Australian Kyrgios had beaten Djokovic in the quarterfinals in Acapulco almost two weeks ago in their first career meeting, and repeated the feat on Wednesday to reach the last eight, and a meeting with Federer. "That felt good to kind of prove it wasn’t a one-off thing," Kyrgios said. "It felt good to back it up again." A break in the first game of the match was enough to give Kyrgios the opening set. Djokovic saved two break points late in the second set as they battled to the tiebreaker which Kyrgios dominated, sealing the win, fittingly, with a final monster serve. "It’s a gamble," Djokovic said of trying to anticipate Kyrgios’s first serve. "His second serve, if you think you’re going to have a look at it, you don’t, because he goes for it as well." Kyrgios said that aggressive second serve is a cornerstone of his game. Federer defeated Nadal 6-2 6-3 in the 36th meeting between the pair. It marked the first time Federer had recorded three consecutive wins over the 30-year-old Spaniard. "It’s a nice feeling to win the last three, I can tell you that," Federer told reporters. "After the Australian hype, to play here in America right away, all of them are very special. Obviously I can’t celebrate too long this time around. "I have to get back to work in a couple of days."
