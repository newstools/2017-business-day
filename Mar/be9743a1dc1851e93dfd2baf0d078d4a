The new trade union federation, which has been championed by former Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi, has been registered officially with the Department of Labour.The new labour organisation could rival or even be bigger than the ANC&rsquo;s alliance partner Cosatu, as it claims that more than 40 unions had expressed interest in signing up.It was registered on Friday under the name South African Federation of Trade Unions. Registration will now allow the new federation to start operating and recruiting membership.The name would be ratified or changed at the launching congress to be held from April 21-23, said Vavi, the convener of the new federation&rsquo;s steering committee.The aim of the new federation was to win back the trust of workers, he said."Unless we can win back the confidence [of the workers] we will be another Cosatu or we will just be adding numbers. We don&rsquo;t want to add numbers, we want to make a difference."So we are acutely aware that the issue of winning confidence and trust is going to be the most important campaign of whether we going to be the guys who further fragment the trade union movement more instead of being the ones who truly liberated the [workers]."Vavi said 21 unions had received mandates and budgets to support the new federation and had officially signed up."That&rsquo;s what we used to register the federation. We said here are the 21 unions that have a congress mandate," he said. Another 18 unions still needed a mandate from their members before joining, Vavi said.Among the 18 were some of Cosatu&rsquo;s affiliates.Those unions which had not yet signed up would be allowed to attend the federation&rsquo;s congress in April but would not have voting powers.Vavi said the new federation was insisting that unions receive a mandate from their members before joining.Cosatu&rsquo;s membership base has declined enormously after it expelled its largest affiliate, the National Union of Metalworkers of SA at the end of 2014 and after the Food and Allied Workers Union left the federation in August 2016.It is believed that these two unions were among the new federation&rsquo;s key affiliates.Vavi was expelled from Cosatu in March 2015 after a long struggle with Cosatu and the governing ANC.Unlike Cosatu, which is allied to the ANC, Vavi said the new federation would not be aligned to any political party.The new body had learned a great deal from the Cosatu experience that such unions could be prejudicial to worker issues, Vavi said.Various Cosatu leaders took sides when the ANC formed factions at the Mangaung elective conference where Jacob Zuma was elected president for a second term.The federation must be unaligned politically, after growing concerns of disaffection over political parties, which Vavi said was evident in the results of 2016&rsquo;s local government elections and in the continued fragmentation of organised labour.Cosatu spokesman Sizwe Pamla said the trade union federation did not have any view on the new federation. "We have to respect their right to do so. Preferably we would have wanted a situation where workers unite, but we can&rsquo;t stop anyone from forming anything."Cosatu would not talk on behalf of any affiliate if they were considering a move to the new federation, Pamla said. But at February&rsquo;s central executive committee its affiliates had said they were committed to Cosatu.
