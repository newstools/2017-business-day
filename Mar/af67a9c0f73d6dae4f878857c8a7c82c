The Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (Irba) has expressed concern about the slow pace of transformation in the auditing profession.There are 41 black-owned asset management companies in the country.Concern was raised on Tuesday, as Parliament&rsquo;s finance and trade and industry committees held a public hearing on the transformation of the financial services sector.Irba CEO Bernard Agulhas The Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors says of the almost 4,300 registered auditors, 74.8% are white and only 10.5% are black African said in a statement that transformation had to mean truly empowering black accountants and black-owned auditing firms, "which includes providing equal opportunities to access the audit market."Previously, the lack of progression of young black professionals to the highest level in audit firms has been explained by the assumption that many young black accountants complete their articles and leave auditing for more lucrative roles in the government, the corporate sector or to explore entrepreneurial opportunities. This is frequently cited as a challenge for the sector in its transformation initiatives."The harsh reality is that of the 4,283 registered auditors in SA, 74.8% are white and only 10.5% are black African. More must be done," Agulhas said."It s not just about increasing the number of black trainee accountants; it s about giving black accountants and auditors long-term prospects in the profession equivalent to that of their counterparts. It requires a cultural shift and a more inclusive approach, which will provide black accountants with a positive experience at the firms that will result in higher retention."Agulhas said more focus had to be given to long-term career prospects, including equity partnerships and senior management and executive responsibility."High on the Irba agenda is a desire to capacitate mid-tier and home-grown audit firms, and build a more diverse profession with increased opportunities. Currently, exposure of black-owned firms to the auditing of JSE-listed companies is minimal, with up to 94% of the market capitalisation of the JSE being audited by the big four audit firms comprising Deloitte, KPMG, EY and PriceWaterhouseCoopers."Agulhas said: "It is critical that our black-owned firms be given access to the same opportunities. We need to see them growing in scale and capability. This cannot happen unless we create the opportunity for them to have equal access to the markets. Of the approximately 65 black African auditors accredited to sign off on 300-odd JSE-listed companies financial statements, fewer than nine have the opportunity to do so, according to our research."
