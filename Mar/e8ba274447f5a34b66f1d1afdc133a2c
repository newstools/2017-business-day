Police have arrested three suspects in connection with the burglary at the Office of the Chief Justice at the weekend‚ a source said on Wednesday. The suspects are due to appear in the Mamelodi Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday morning. Thieves made off with 15 computers containing sensitive information on Constitutional Court judges and officials after breaking into Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng’s offices in Midrand‚ Johannesburg‚ in the early hours of Saturday. Acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane is expected to brief the media at 9am on the burglary. The burglary drew condemnation from politicians‚ including the DA and ANC‚ which said it raised fear that the break-in was an attack on the judiciary. The incident came a day after a highly contentious ruling in which the Constitutional Court ordered the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) to extend a contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) to distribute social grants.
