The JSE opened flat on Tuesday ahead of the release of GDP numbers as the Dow closed weaker on Monday amid concern about President Donald Trump’s economic policies. Gold shares retreated while platinum stocks recovered marginally after a weak Monday, with the platinum price remaining under pressure. The platinum price was 0.26% lower at $974.63 an ounce in early morning trade. The Dow has climbed 6.03% so far this year in anticipation of Trump’s lower tax and fiscal expansionary policies. But so far little detail has emerged. The Dow closed 0.24% lower at 20,954.34 on Monday. Asian markets were mixed on Tuesday morning, with the Nikkei 225 losing 0.18% and the Hang Seng gaining 0.33%. "Profit taking following recent strength and the increased possibility of a US Federal Reserve rate hike next week caused the weakness on the Dow," Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking analysts said. Local GDP growth for 2016 is expected to come in at 0.5% but a weaker figure could add pressure on the JSE. At 9.38am the all share was 0.09% lower at 51,450.30 points and the blue-chip top 40 softened 0.06%. The gold index dropped 2.02% and banks shed 0.27%. Food and drug retailers softened 0.24%. Resources were down 0.20%. The platinum index gained 0.10%. Among gold stocks Harmony dropped 4.14% to R28 and Sibanye shed 1.54% to R25. Among platinums Lonmin rebounded 2.17% to R16.49 after losing 8.5% on Monday. Capitec was flat at R737 after informing the market on Monday it expected full-year earnings to end February to increase up to 19%. Nedbank was down 1.04% to R255.32 and Barclays Africa lost 0.69% to R153.43. Steinhoff shed 0.76% to R64.04. Among property stocks Sirius rose 1.51% to R8.05. The German office space property group has moved to the JSE’s main board. Hammerson was an early performer in the property sector, rising 4.72% to R97.70. IT company Net1 UEPS was up 0.88% at R175.01. The group, which owns Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), is set to benefit from a new contract with the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa). Naspers was marginally up 0.22% to R2,122.18, despite a relatively upbeat performance from Tencent Holdings in Hong Kong. Naspers owns 34% of Tencent. "I was surprised that Naspers did not benefit more from Tencent’s rise in Hong Trade," said Herenya Capital Advisors analyst Petri Redelinghuys. "To a degree, the stronger rand mitigated further advances at Naspers," he said. Consumer group AVI was 0.52% lower at R98.19. The group reported on Monday that headline earnings per share rose 7.6% to R30.29 in the six months to end-December.
