Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe opposed the removal of Pravin Gordhan as finance minister at a tense meeting of the ANC top six officials held before Thursday’s late night Cabinet reshuffle. While the two did not object to the reshuffle in principle, or to President Jacob Zuma’s right to do it, the manner in which Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, were removed — on the basis of a spurious “intelligence report” — was the reason for their objections. Business Day on Friday morning reliably learnt that ANC treasurer general Zweli Mkhize was also opposed to the reshuffle. However, Ramaphosa has made no indication that he will resign, and he and his backers appear to continue to believe that, at present, he is more effective in the Cabinet than out. Just after midnight Zuma issued a statement announcing a Cabinet reshuffle in which he replaced Gordhan with Malusi Gigaba, who was home affairs minister. Jonas was replaced by Sfiso Buthelezi. Mantashe, speaking on PowerFM shortly after the reshuffle, said it was the first time there had been major disagreements over the reshuffle and that Zuma had presented his plans to the officials rather than consulted them. He said that in the end, however, the decision lay with Zuma.
