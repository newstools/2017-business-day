Sydney &mdash; The dollar clung to broad gains on Friday as the risk of an imminent US interest rate increase slugged sovereign bonds and commodities, even managing to sour Wall Street&rsquo;s party as the reality of rising borrowing costs began to sink in.Spread-betters pointed to opening losses for European stocks and E-mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 were off 0.3%. Asian markets were mostly lower, with MSCI&rsquo;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.9% in the biggest daily drop so far this year.Australia fell 0.8% and Shanghai 0.4%. Japan&rsquo;s Nikkei eased 0.7% as a weaker yen only helped limit some of the losses.South Korean shares dropped to a two-week low early as reports came in that China had ordered tour operators to stop selling trips to the country, amid rising tension over the deployment of a US missile-defence system.A chorus line of Fed officials singing of the need for higher rates has seen the implied probability of a move in March shoot to 74%, from just 30% at the start of the week.Fed chair Janet Yellen and vice-chair Stanley Fischer are both due to speak later on Friday and are expected to stick to the same tune."The US dollar has been snapped up across the board as a March Fed hike is heavily priced in," said Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist at Westpac."All it took was about 100 comments from Fed officials, but markets have finally decided that &lsquo;fairly soon&rsquo; means less than two weeks and that perhaps three hikes this year means three hikes this year."That was enough to make even Wall Street pause, and the Dow fell 0.53%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.59% and the Nasdaq 0.73%. Caterpillar was among the biggest casualties, shedding 4.2% on news that federal law enforcement officials searched its Illinois facilities.The prospect of a Fed increase on March 15 saw yields on two-year treasury notes shatter their recent range to reach ground last trod in mid-2009.With the European Central Bank (ECB) still acting to suppress short-term euro rates, the spread between US and German two-year yields yawned out to 214 basis points, the widest since early 2000 and up from a low of 183 in January.That shoved the euro down to $1.0515 and set up a test of major support at the February low of $1.0492. The dollar likewise held at &yen;114.18 and eyed the recent peak of &yen;114.95. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased a fraction to 102.010 after touching its highest since January 11.That strength was not good news for commodities priced in dollars with everything from gold to copper taking a hit.Gold was stuck at $1,233.50/oz, after suffering its biggest one-day decline since December on Thursday.Oil prices took an extra blow after Russian crude production remained unchanged in February, showing weak compliance with a global deal to curb supply to tighten the oversupplied market.Early on Friday, US crude was up 6c at $52.67, having shed more than 2% on Thursday, while Brent edged up 7c to $55.15 a barrel.Reuters
