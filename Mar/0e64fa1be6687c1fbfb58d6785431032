Cosatu has accepted the proposed national minimum wage, but taken a hardline against Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini over the looming social grants crisis.In February, in the lead-up to the state of the nation address, the union federation pulled out of a national minimum wage signing ceremony, putting a damper on what had been billed an historic moment.Cosatu had cited the need to consult its central executive committee (CEC).Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali, who was speaking after a three-day CEC meeting, said on Thursday that, while the proposed R20 did not reach the minimum living standards of an average South African household, "it is a significant starting base".The federation has mandated its leadership to sign the agreement on the minimum wage, adding that the real work would now begin as legislation is drafted to give effect to it.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, who led the talks that culminated in the national minimum wage agreement, hailed Cosatu&rsquo;s "very constructive approach"."This endorsement represents the will of the working people of our country and enables the initiation of a public consultation process that will ultimately result in new legislation that will regulate implementation of the national minimum wage by no later than May 2018," Ramaphosa said in a statement on Wednesday.Cosatu leadership emerged from the CEC adopting a public posture on other issues that is indicative of a widening rift between the trade union federation and President Jacob Zuma s administration.Cosatu has already endorsed Ramaphosa as its preferred successor to Zuma when the ANC elects new leaders at a national conference in December.On Thursday, Cosatu called on Zuma to fire Dlamini an ally who is also president of the ANC Women s League over the "inept" manner in which she is dealing with the uncertainty surrounding the distribution of social grants. Dlamini is driving the campaign to install Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as ANC president.Ntshalintshali said the minister and her officials should be dismissed or must resign. "This is not just an administrative bungling but it is a political own goal that smells of corruption."At a previous post-CEC briefing, Cosatu called for the removal of Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane.
