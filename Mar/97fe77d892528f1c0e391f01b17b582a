London &mdash; BT Group has named Jan du Plessis as its new chairman, selecting an experienced businessman who has guided Rio Tinto for eight years and helped engineer SABMiller&rsquo;s $104bn sale.Du Plessis will start in the role on November 1, after joining the board as a nonexecutive director on June 1, the former British telephone monopoly said in a statement Thursday. He was planning to step down as chairman of Rio Tinto&rsquo;s board in 2018 after promising he would stay for two years following Jean-Sebastien Jacques&rsquo;s promotion to CEO in March 2016, a person familiar with the matter said.As chairman, Du Plessis will have to help lead BT as it seeks to rebound from a tough year, including an accounting scandal in Italy and a slowdown in its government and corporate outsourcing divisions.BT is also battling regulators over the future of its UK network division even as it seeks to retain customers by expanding into pay-TV and mobile-phone services, going head-to-head with rivals including Sky and Vodafone Group.Du Plessis has a reputation as a hands-on director. As chairman of SABMiller in 2015 and 2016, he helped negotiate a sweetened bid by Anheuser-Busch InBev before agreeing to recommend the takeover."He&rsquo;s an action man," Eamonn Ferry, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas who watched Du Plessis at SABMiller, said in a phone interview. "Shareholders like him. He&rsquo;s no-nonsense, he gets things done."BT&rsquo;s current chairman, Mike Rake, is stepping down after 10 years in the role, the longest tenure of any director at the company.During his time as chairman of Rio Tinto, Du Plessis steered the mining company through unprecedented volatility from the peak of the China-fuelled commodities boom early this decade to its trough in 2015 when investors fled the sector as debt concerns mounted.He fended off a hostile takeover approach from rival BHP Billiton shortly after taking on the role and more recently spurned an approach from Swiss commodity trader Glencore.He is also no stranger to brushes with global regulators. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating a $3bn impairment charge Rio booked on a Mozambique coal deal. Last October, Rio Tinto self-reported to the US Department of Justice, the UK&rsquo;s Serious Fraud Office and an Australian regulator about a payment to a consultant in Guinea.Rio Tinto&rsquo;s Sydney-listed shares declined 2% to A$60.14 in Thursday trading, trimming their advance in the past 12 months to 36%.Du Plessis also previously served as chairman of British American Tobacco and Lloyds Banking Group.Bloomberg
