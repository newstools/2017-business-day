Three of SA&rsquo;s major banks as well as its savings and investment institutions have defended their achievements on transformation, while acknowledging much more could be done.They stressed the importance of well-regulated, large and stable financial institutions as a key facilitator of economic growth and investment and for protecting people&rsquo;s savings.But the views of Barclays Africa, Standard Bank, FirstRand and the Association of Savings and Investment SA (Asisa) were not fully supported by all 22 entities that spoke at the hearing on financial sector transformation run by Parliament&rsquo;s finance and trade and industry committees on Tuesday.MPs heard that black ownership in Barclays Africa stood at 17.36% with a greater share due to become available when Barclays divests its shareholding.FirstRand said blacks owned 36.5%, while Standard Bank emphasised the spread of its share ownership among institutional investors and pension funds in which ordinary citizens invested their savings.Challenges were identified in increasing black representation among the top leadership as well as on the employment equity frontWhile Cosatu criticised the concentration of ownership by monopolistic banks, finance institutions and insurers, Asisa chairman Thabo Dloti highlighted the stiff competition that prevailed in the sector.The South African Communist Party called for the break-up of the large monopolies to allow new players to enter the sector.The Association of Black Securities and Investment Professionals said while the transformation of the financial sector had been slow, there had been some progress. More could still be done and at a faster pace."There isn&rsquo;t enough change in terms of black professionals playing a leading role in firms. This is especially true of leadership and key decision-making roles," the association said.The Black Business Council laid down a number of stringent conditions which it said would have to be complied with if the goal of radical economic transformation was to be achieved.These included the requirement that all new insurance licences be restricted to companies with a minimum black ownership of 51%; set asides of up to 35% for black entrepreneurs as a condition of licences; the allocation of a minimum of 51% of new banking licences to black-owned companies; the allocation of at least a minimum of 30% of financial services companies to black asset managers; and the establishment of a financial sector commission to monitor the progress and performance of the sector with regard to transformation.The council also said 51% of government expenditure must be set aside for procurement from black-owned companies and a minimum of R30bn must be made available by the government in partnership with the financial services sector to fund the black industrialist programme.Treasury deputy director-general Ismail Momoniat noted that the asset management industry was the least transformed sub-sector of the financial services industry and needed to do more than other sub-sectors in this regard.He stressed that meaningful transformation of the financial services sector was not merely a question of ownership but the manner in which it supported real economic activity.This included the development of black-owned enterprises, access and inclusion of black households in the sector, the promotion of asset wealth of black households and the provision of better access to funding for small businesses.
