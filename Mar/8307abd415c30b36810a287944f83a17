Transport and logistics group Grindrod withheld a final dividend as its full-year losses widened. The company suffered a net loss of R1.8bn in the year to December, up from loss R1.3bn in the year-earlier period. The company attributed the financial performance to depressed market conditions in the first half of the year and impairments in the shipping and freight services rail businesses. The Durban-based company wrote down the value of its rail manufacturing businesses by further R644m. "The rail manufacturing businesses continued to experience constraints with the cancellation of planned capital investments in mining projects in Africa," the company said in a statement. "Given the subsequent anticipated inability to secure the desired, sustainable return in these businesses, the Grindrod strategy was reviewed and a decision was taken to withdraw from the rail manufacturing businesses." Losses attributable to shareholders in the freight services business widened to R1.23bn from R108.99m, with losses in shipping coming in at R928.41m â€” an improvement from loss of R1.49bn. The company noted, however, that trading conditions had improved in the second half of its financial year. The stock was up 1.37% to R14.09 in midmorning trade on the JSE on Thursday, valuing the company at R10.7bn.
