Springbok coach Allister Coetzee is adamant he will not be out of a job if his team fails to beat France during the Test series in SA in June.There are rumours Coetzee could be axed if the Springboks fail to beat the visitors in the three-Test series, which starts on June 10 at Loftus Versfeld."I signed last year until 2019 and the contract hasn&rsquo;t changed and, personally&sbquo; I take it that in every Test where you go and represent the Springboks&sbquo; there is a gun against your head to perform and it&rsquo;s there for everyone&sbquo;" Coetzee said.The coach presided over the worst Springbok calendar year, with only four wins from 12 matches. Among the matches the Boks lost were to Ireland at home&sbquo; to Italy in Florence and a record defeat to the All Blacks in Durban.Coetzee also said he was happy with SA Rugby&rsquo;s new policy on overseas players that allows only players with more than 30 Tests to be eligible for national selection."There&rsquo;s no limit on the [number] of overseas-based players I can pick and I&rsquo;m happy with the policy that has been put into place."There are players who have done their hard yards and have taken part in 30 Tests and they also need to take part in the succession plan for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and be available for that," Coetzee said."The big thing about the policy is about retaining a young player or a potential Springbok and make them think twice about going overseas."Coetzee also had two new backroom staff members in Franco Smith and Brendan Venter, added last week after Mzwandile Stick and Chean Roux were demoted to the Under-20s.SA Rugby&rsquo;s delay in announcing the names made it seem that there had been indecision finalising the selection and Coetzee gave the impression that Venter&rsquo;s inclusion hung in the balance.Coetzee sidestepped a question on whether he had played a role in hiring Smith and Venter, but he confirmed a defence coach had been earmarked for appointment."I know Franco Smith is signed and sealed, but the other name I just see when Italy plays and when Eddie Jones and the other guy talk about him."It&rsquo; s very interesting. There will be a defence coach that&rsquo;ll be appointed."TMG Digital
