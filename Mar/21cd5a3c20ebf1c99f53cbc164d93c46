The South African bond market was flat in early trade on Friday following Thursday’s strong performance. Local bonds were strong on Thursday as a result of a rand rally. The rand had firmed against major currencies after the US Federal Reserve increased rates but gave no indication it would increase the pace of tightening in 2017. Standard Bank analysts said the rand "traded like the king of all currencies over the last 36 hours" and that it was the best-performing currency in the world following the Fed’s announcement. The market had previously held the consensus that the US rate increase would weaken the rand, but the Fed’s "conservative approach to future rate hikes" led to the opposite effect, the analysts said. At 8.27 am the R186 was unchanged at 8.530% while the R207 was bid at 7.575% from 7.570% previously. The US 10-year treasury bond bid at 2.5297% from Thursday’s 2.4941%.
