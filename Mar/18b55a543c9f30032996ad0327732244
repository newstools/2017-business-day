The South African Revenue Service (SARS) was sitting on R20bn in value-added tax (VAT) refunds that were claimed but not paid out by the end of February, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Thursday. Taxpayers are complaining that they are not getting their tax refunds paid timeously. The figure provided by Gordhan suggests there might be some substance to their complaints and also gives an idea of the extent of the problem. The information from Gordhan was contained in his written reply to a parliamentary question by DA deputy finance spokesman Alf Lees. It came a few days after the announcement that Tax Ombud Judge Bernard Ngoepe had been given the go-ahead by the finance ministry to conduct a systemic investigation of tax refunds by SARS. The ombud has been inundated with complaints about SARS’s delays in paying refunds. Allegations have been made that the tax authority has withheld tax refunds to boost its tax revenue collection performance. SARS has strongly denied these allegations and is likely to bring up the issue again when it releases the provisional revenue collection figure for 2016-17 early in April. Gordhan’s reply showed that by end-February the total amount claimed during the 2016-17 tax year in VAT refunds amounted to R129.3bn. The unpaid R20bn portion represents a significant percentage. The minister qualified his reply, saying that the information he was providing was submitted by SARS and had not been verified by the Treasury. Gordhan noted that the total value of VAT refunds still being audited at end-February was R17.3bn, compared with R12bn on February 29 2016. The potential magnitude of the problem is apparent in that altogether 343,674 VAT refunds were claimed in 2016-17, of which 43,650 were not refunded by end February. Gordhan noted that only returns required during the period in question were included and all late returns and/or carry-over returns from previous years were excluded. Lees said that the information provided by Gordhan seemed to confirm the complaints by taxpayers that VAT refunds had not been refunded timeously “and are possibly being deliberately delayed”. He said: “We urge the tax ombud to waste no time in getting to the bottom of delayed VAT, diesel, income-tax and other refunds.” The total value of VAT refunds claimed for the period March 1 2015 to February 29 2016 was R128bn, of which R18bn was not refunded by February 29 2016. The total number of VAT refunds claimed for the period was 341,167 of which 34,132 claims were not refunded by February 29 2016.
