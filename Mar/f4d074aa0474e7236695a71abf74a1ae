Sydney — Former Wallabies lock Dan Vickerman was remembered as a "colossal" man who gave selflessly to rugby at an emotional public memorial in Sydney on Wednesday. The South African-born forward died at the age of 37 in February, shining the spotlight on the mental health of retired athletes. Hundreds of fans, friends and former teammates gathered at the Sydney University Oval where he played club rugby through a career featuring 63 Tests for the Wallabies and three World Cup campaigns. "He was such a colossal man. His character was so true, his values so strong, his behaviour so authentic," former University teammate Chris Malone said. He had seemed the perfect role model for players looking to manage the transition into life after sport. He was appointed chairman of an Australian Rugby Union and players’ association committee for player development in 2016. But he had also confided with friends that he had struggled to leave the game behind. Reuters
