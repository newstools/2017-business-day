Bengaluru &mdash; Australia captain Steve Smith was a "role model" and allegations that he and his team flouted the rules when deciding whether to review decisions during the second Test against India were "outrageous", Cricket Australia said on Wednesday.Incensed India captain Virat Kohli accused Smith of "crossing the line" on Tuesday when he was given out lbw but looked towards the players&rsquo; area in the Bengaluru stands as he mulled over using the Decision Review System. Players are not allowed to seek direction apart from conferring with the nonstriker.Smith said it had been a one-off incident caused by a "brain fade", but Kohli countered that it was not the first time it had happened and that he had complained to the match officials.Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland said: "I find the allegations questioning the integrity of Steve Smith, the Australian team and the dressing room, outrageous. Steve is an outstanding cricketer and person, and role model to many aspiring cricketers and we have every faith that there was no ill-intent in his actions."We reject any commentary that suggests our integrity was brought into disrepute or systemic unfair tactics are used."Australia coach Darren Lehmann denied his team had repeatedly sought dressing room assistance on reviews."Never, ever, ever," Lehmann said. "Very surprised to hear that, but it&rsquo;s their opinion."He [Kohli] has his opinion and we have ours, but at the end of the day we play the game the right way.... We&rsquo;ve never done any of that, so we&rsquo;ll just get on with the next game."The Indian board issued a statement throwing its weight behind Kohli later on Wednesday, describing the home captain as a "mature and seasoned cricketer" whose "conduct on the field has been exemplary"."The Board of Control for Cricket in India, after due deliberation and seeing the video replays of the episode, steadfastly stands with the Indian cricket team and its captain, Virat Kohli," the board said.It said Kohli&rsquo;s action was supported by International Cricket Council (ICC) elite panel umpire Nigel Llong, "who rushed in to dissuade Steve Smith from taking recourse to inappropriate assistance".The board hoped the rest of the series would be played in the true spirit of cricket.Peter Handscomb, who was at the nonstriker&rsquo;s end during the incident, tweeted after the 75-run defeat that he was to blame. "I referred smudga [Smith] to look at the box ... my fault and was unaware of the rule. Shouldn&rsquo;t take anything away from what was an amazing game!" he wrote.The Times of India ran a story headlined "Cheatgate erupts after Smith&rsquo;s &lsquo;brain fade&rsquo;".Kohli&rsquo;s accusations and any action taken by the ICC are bound to reverberate in coming days, with the four-match series locked at 1-1 before the third Test in Ranchi next week.Reuters
