Factory managers perked up further in February after swinging from pessimism to optimism in January, a monthly poll sponsored by Absa showed on Tuesday.February&rsquo;s purchasing managers index (PMI) came in at 52.5 points from January&rsquo;s 50.9 points.A score above 50 indicates an expanding manufacturing sector. The monthly poll, done for Absa by Stellenbosch University&rsquo;s Bureau of Economic Research, had been on the pessimistic side of 50 points for five months from August to December.The surveys of purchasing managers tend to be a good forecaster of the manufacturing volume and sales data Statistics SA publishes a month later.Absa&rsquo;s PMI has eight constituents. Dishearteningly for job seekers, the employment component decreased to 46.5 points in February from 48.2 points in January.The only other constituent below 50, backlog of sales orders, improved to 42.1 from 33.7 points.Purchasing commitments swung from a pessimistic 44.2 to an optimistic 51.7 points.Expected business conditions, which hit a seven-year high of 70.3 in January, settled back to 67.8 in January."The second consecutive improvement in the PMI and the broad-based nature of the uptick across the key subcomponents is a positive sign that the manufacturing sector started the year on a solid footing. Indeed, four of the five major subcomponents are above the neutral 50-point mark and the headline figure is at the highest level since June 2016," Absa said."After the increases recorded in January and February, the headline figure is closer to that of SA&rsquo;s main trading partners, after underperforming through the second half of 2016," Absa said.Standard Bank publishes a PMI it sponsors on Friday morning. The Standard Bank sponsored PMI tends to be more optimistic, with a score of 51.3 in January against Absa&rsquo;s 50.9 points.
