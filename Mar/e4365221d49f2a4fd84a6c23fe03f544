Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini says she will respect and adhere to the ruling made by the Constitutional Court on Friday morning. She said her staff were still studying the judgment‚ but she was pleased for the people of SA. Speaking at a stakeholder engagement meeting in Kempton Park‚ she assured all present that grants would be paid come April 1. The Constitutional Court ruled that the contract between Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) and the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) would be extended for 12 months‚ under stringent conditions. Dlamini also said that when she appeared before Parliament on Tuesday‚ she missed an opportunity. “I have a close friend‚ a young man who always listens when I speak, and he will phone me if I say something wrong‚” Dlamini said. “He called me on Tuesday‚ and told me I had missed an important opportunity‚ to say sorry. “The first thing I was supposed to do‚ is to apologise to South Africans. And I thought that was profound. I also want to again repeat‚ I am so sorry.” TMG Digital
