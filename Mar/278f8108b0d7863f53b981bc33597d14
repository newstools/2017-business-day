The Cabinet has decided to solicit the guidance of an interministerial committee to determine whether to go ahead with SA’s exit from the International Criminal Court, Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe said on Thursday. Speaking to reporters in Parliament, Radebe said the Cabinet had noted the North Gauteng High Court ruling last week, which invalidated the government’s announced intention to leave the ICC and the Rome Statute. The move to leave the ICC came after SA did not arrest Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir when he visited the country for an AU summit in 2015, in contravention of the statute. "Cabinet is aware that Parliament is considering the appropriate course of action. Cabinet abides by the ruling and has established a technical task team to develop a compliance road map," said Radebe. The technical task team and an interministerial committee will work on ensuring the government complies with the court order, while Parliament decides how to address the recent submission of the Implementation of The Rome Statute and International Criminal Court Act Repeal Bill to the legislature. "Cabinet has decided to abide by the judgment by the high court. There is a special interministerial chaired by International Relations and Co-operation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane which will outline in detail the compliance of the North Gauteng High Court," he said.
