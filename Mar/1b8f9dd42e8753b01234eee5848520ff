New Port Richey, Florida &mdash; The day after the flaming out of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s first major legislative initiative, his supporters across the US were lashing out &mdash; at conservatives, at Democrats, at leaders of his Republican Party in Congress.Only Trump himself was spared their wrath.Many voters who elected him appeared willing to give him a pass on the collapse of his campaign promise to overhaul the healthcare system, stressing his short time in office."Being a businessman, he&rsquo;ll not take &lsquo;no&rsquo; for an answer," said Tony Nappi, a 71-year-old softball player from Trinity, Florida, one of many disappointed Republicans. "He&rsquo;ll get the job done."Support for Trump appeared unflagging, from the playing fields of a Republican stronghold in central Florida to the diners of North Carolina, the suburbs of Arkansas and the streets of working-class Staten Island.Rebellion among members of his own party sealed the failure of Trump&rsquo;s effort to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act &mdash; known as Obamacare &mdash; the signature domestic policy achievement of Democratic former president Barack Obama.Despite casting himself on the campaign trail as "the best deal maker there is", Trump could not save the healthcare bill yanked from the voting schedule by Republican leaders in the House of Representatives on Friday in an embarrassing turn of events for them and Trump. Objections among Republican moderates and the party&rsquo;s most conservative legislators left leaders short of the votes needed for passage, with Democrats unified in opposition."He can&rsquo;t wave a magic wand," said Ramona Bourdo, 70, a retired nurse, eating breakfast at a McDonald&rsquo;s in suburban Little Rock, Arkansas. "I&rsquo;ve not lost confidence in him."Still, the barista at the Grind Cafe in Morganton, North Carolina, who cannot afford his own insurance and remains on his parents&rsquo; plan, felt Trump shared responsibility in the debacle."I think it&rsquo;s partially his fault," said 21-year-old Republican and Trump supporter Joel Martin."I don&rsquo;t think he has enough personal knowledge to do what he needs to do to get a healthcare bill through Congress."His hometown sits within the heavily rural congressional district of representative Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican whose opposition as the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus helped sink the bill.Sharing in the frustration of loyal Republicans was 82-year-old Jeanette Madison, a registered independent in the New York City borough of Staten Island, who voted for Trump."I blame the Democrats and Republicans in Congress. They are a bunch of bastards. I&rsquo;m just fed up," she said, apologising for colourful language as she walked her dog.Neighbours Patti Niehaus, a Democrat, and Margie Hahne, a Republican, agreed that new politician Trump may have needed last week&rsquo;s crash course in governing."You can&rsquo;t just go and tell people what to do like he&rsquo;s used to doing," said Hahne, 74. "Trump&rsquo;s got to learn a lot."Bridging Tampa&rsquo;s booming suburbs and still rural parts of central Florida, Pasco County lies in a politically decisive swing region of the state along the Interstate 4 highway corridor linking Tampa and Orlando.Trump won 58.4% of the vote in the mostly white, working-and middle-class county, surpassing the past two Republican presidential candidates by tens of thousands of votes.His pledge to end Obamacare helped to sway Kelle DeGroat, a 37-year-old nurse, a Republican who is open to other parties."I thought there was a good plan the way he talked," said DeGroat, still confident in Trump&rsquo;s ability to make reform happen. "I was shocked that it didn&rsquo;t pass."Other Republicans applauded their leaders for returning to the drawing board, with polls showing the derailed healthcare plan to be unpopular following predictions it would jeopardise or increase the cost of insurance for millions.Lisa Collins, a 53-year-old Republican and teacher who did not support Trump, said: "This is a success that the party listened. To me, that&rsquo;s amazing."Reuters
