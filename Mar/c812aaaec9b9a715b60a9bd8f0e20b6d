Advtech has developed strong tertiary education brands that should help it to remain the leader in private education. It is no longer the laggard it once was and is outdoing the competition, says boutique investment house Cratos Wealth."Advtech is a shining example of the private education model. Its tertiary colleges are very strong. These are larger, in terms of students enrolled in accredited degrees, than any South African public university except for Unisa [University of SA]," portfolio manager at Cratos Wealth Ron Klipin said on Friday. He said these colleges would likely develop into fully fledged private universities.Advtech&rsquo;s tertiary division includes The Independent Institute of Education, Varsity College, The Business School at Varsity College in Rosebank, Vega, The Design School Southern Africa and the tertiary brands Capsicum Culinary Studio and the Oxbridge Academy.It had a national footprint of 27 campuses at the end of 2016.By close of trade on Friday, Advtech&rsquo;s share price had climbed 19.45% in calendar 2017, to R20.51. According to its financial results for the year to December 2016, tertiary education constitutes 37% of Advtech&rsquo;s group revenue.Tertiary revenue shot up 28% to R1.3bn, while operating margins were up from 14% to 18%."This shows a substantial turnaround from earlier days when this business was floundering," Klipin said."The successful placing in employment of 81% of Advtech graduates is testimony to the high level of education provided by Advtech degrees, which are accredited with the British accreditation council," he said."We are seeing a major roll-out of distance learning and blended learning that should be another catalyst for growth. The group is awaiting an okay for 16 new degrees from the department of higher education."They really are developing a sophisticated tertiary education business," Klipin said.&nbsp;
