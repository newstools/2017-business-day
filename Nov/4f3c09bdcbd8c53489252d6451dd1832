Parliamentary officials came out in support of measures to control heckling and jeers during plenary sessions, including disabling microphones. Acting secretaries of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces held a dialogue session in Cape Town about the working relationship between parties that had been affected by unprecedented levels of tension. Secretary to the National Assembly Masibulele Xaso said insults hurled at members weighed on the functioning of Parliament. "No member may impute improper motives to any other member or cast personal reflections on a memberâ€™s integrity or dignity or verbally abuse a member in any other way. "This rule also applies to the president, minister or deputy minister who is not a member, or the house," he said. Acting National Council of Provinces secretary Modibedi Phindela said that members expressed great frustration with the unwillingness of presiding officers to permit the pursuit of questions MPs felt had not been satisfactorily answered. But that did not necessarily mean a question had not been answered, Xaso said. He said that the rules allowed the presiding officer to disable a microphone if a member failed to respect their authority as long as the offending MP had been notified. Parliament spokesman Moloto Mothapo said the dialogue was a "critical discussion because there is huge debate among the public, media, academia and other stakeholders about it. "The rules are not just an internal policy for the institution, but are very key and find expression in the constitution," Mothapo said. magubanek@businesslive.co.za
