The rand was firmer against major global currencies shortly before midday on Wednesday, tracking a stronger euro, and following the release of inflation data for October. Statistics SA’s consumer price index for October rose 4.8% year-on-year, in line with market expectations. However, core inflation was slightly lower than expected, at 4.5% compared with a Trading Economics forecast of 4.6%. Softening core price pressures may temper expectations in the market for any interest rate increase in the next few months, said Capital Economics analysts, but with inflation set to rise in November after an increase in oil prices, the tone of Thursday’s Reserve Bank meeting was likely to be hawkish. The Bank was widely expected to keep rates on hold on Thursday, amid a litany of risk factors, notably to the rand. The rand was also supported by developments in Zimbabwe, gaining late on Tuesday after Robert Mugabe resigned. The rand immediately firmed below R14 on the news, but stalled at R13.9614 as the market awaited further developments. The rand’s next target was R13.85/$, but trading was expected to be cautious, Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking analysts said. At 11.30am the rand was at R13.9352 to the dollar from R13.9706, at R16.3923 to the euro from R16.3985 and R18.4599 to the pound from R18.4954. The euro was at $1.1764 from $1.1737.
