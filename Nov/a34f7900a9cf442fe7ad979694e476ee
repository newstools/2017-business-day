Bloemfontein — Musa Nyatama scored against his old club with his first goal for Orlando Pirates as the Buccaneers beat Bloemfontein Celtic 1-0 on Sunday and climbed to second place on the Premier Soccer League standings. They are now a point behind leaders Baroka FC but incredibly have won only four of their 12 league games this season. Nyatama’s strike was only the ninth goal of the season for Pirates‚ which illustrates the poor football the PSL is experiencing at the moment. Pirates had not won in their previous six league games. Sunday’s match was largely a snorefest‚ punctuated by weak crosses‚ loss of possession and poor decision-making. The heat meant the game was never going to be played at a decent tempo and so most of the passing and movement was at pedestrian pace. Pirates had Thamsanqa Sangweni back in midfield but their problems remain upfront where the final touch is increasingly hurried and/or ill-thought. Again‚ Thabo Qalinge was guilty of overelaboration, while Mpho Makola did not shoot when he could. Celtic circulated the ball into an almost comatose state but when they went forward, easily lost possession. Midfielder Lantshene Phalane tried to enliven matters with a long-range shot in the 13th minute, when he spotted Jackson Mabokgwane off his line but was off target. Celtic went close through Ndumiso Mabena shortly after the break but Nyatama’s goal was the only significant event of the second half. Nyatama’s persistence paid off, with Thamsanqa Gabuza assisting and Kabelo Mahlasela failing to clear as Nyatama picked up the loose ball to toe-poke it home. TimesLIVE
