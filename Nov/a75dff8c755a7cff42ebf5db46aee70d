South African government bonds were mixed shortly before midday on Tuesday, with the rand giving up some of the gains from Monday’s rally. The rand had jumped almost 3% to a five-week high on Monday, despite Friday night’s downgrade to junk status by S&P Global Ratings. Moody’s put SA on review for a downgrade next year, citing weak economic growth prospects and a deterioration in public finances. Moody’s also gave SA 90 days to sort out issues related to fiscal consolidation, with the Presidency, on Monday, instructing Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba to address concerns from the medium-term budget policy statement (MTBPS). In the short term, bonds would be responding to rand movements and political news, with the ball very much in Treasury’s court, said Sasfin Securities bond analysts. Among a litany of possible reasons, the most likely was the increased expectation in the market that ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa would prevail at the party’s December elective conference, said Rand Merchant Bank currency strategist John Cairns. "The rand would strengthen far beyond current levels if Ramaphosa wins. Our formal target is R13.50 to the dollar, but based on current starting levels, figures below R13 to the dollar become possible," he said, noting that should a political balance be struck between factions, the local currency should still gain. At 11.30am, the R186 government bond was bid at 9.200% from Monday’s 9.215%, while the R207 was bid at 7.965% from 7.970%. The rand was at R13.7733 to the dollar from R13.7563.
