All that is required to turn around SA’s economy is to fix "regulatory and policy uncertainty as well as corruption and a lack of direction in some areas", South African Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago told a conference in New York on Thursday night. "Setting out some investment-friendly ambitions for the economy and reducing political uncertainty would go a long way towards boosting confidence. As is often said, raising confidence is the cheapest form of stimulus," Kganyago said at the fifth SA Tomorrow Investor Conference. The head of SA’s central bank indicated he was bracing himself for the country’s sovereign credit rating to be reduced to junk by Moody’s and further into junk by S&P Global Ratings on November 24. Many fund managers have mandates prohibiting them from holding junk bonds, and SA wold also fall out of the major bond indices. So a downgrade spells a huge outflow of foreign investment in government bonds. "Estimates of the possible extent of selling by index-tracker funds range between R100bn and R180bn," Kganyago said. Before the 2008 global financial crisis, only 7% of rand-denominated government bonds were held by foreign investors. This has risen to 40%, partly thanks to SA’s inclusion in the Citibank World Government Bond index. SA’s narrower current account deficit and the floating rand would help mitigate a rush of money out of South African bonds, Kganyago said. "That is not to say that we will emerge unscathed should our local-currency debt be downgraded to sub-investment grade. There is little doubt that such a move would impact negatively on the rand, government bond yields, and confidence," Kganyago said. He concluded his speech on an upbeat note: "There is no reason why we cannot get investment and growth going again and make SA an investment destination of choice once more."
