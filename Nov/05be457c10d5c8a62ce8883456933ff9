President Jacob Zuma will soon meet the presidential fiscal committee and Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba to "identify concrete measures to urgently address the challenges identified in the medium-term budget policy statement" "The president, as well as Cabinet have re-affirmed government’s commitment to maintain a sustainable fiscal framework and to ensure that a solution is found to address the roughly R40bn gap that has been identified, through a combination of expenditure reductions and revenue-enhancing measures," the presidency said in a statement. Zuma has directed that Gigaba, the presidential fiscal committee and the National Treasury look for ways to cut expenditure of around R25bn, and create revenue-enhancing measures, including taxes, amounting to about R15bn. He has also tasked them with developing a fiscally-sustainable plan to implement proposed fee-free higher education for disadvantaged students; and identifying a package of economic stimulus measures. This comes after S&P Global Ratings joined Fitch in rating SA’s rand denominated bonds as junk. Moody’s has placed SA on review until the budget announcement in February for a possible downgrade, also to junk.
