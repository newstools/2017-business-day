Thulani Serero says he would rather sit on his sofa at home in the Netherlands than on the bench for Bafana Bafana as he explained his decision to shun the national team. Serero failed to arrive for the double confrontation against Senegal at the conclusion of the World Cup-qualifying campaign after his demand for a berth in the starting line-up was rejected by coach Stuart Baxter. Serero’s international career is now in serious peril at the age of 27 after South African Football Association CEO Denis Mumble said at the weekend the player’s future with Bafana was over. But Serero remains unrepentant after having had to sit on the bench for three previous games, against the Cape Verde Islands (twice) and Burkina Faso, without playing. "The sofa in Arnhem is more comfortable than the South African bench‚" he told the Dutch media. "I have thought about it long and hard. If the national team wants me‚ then I must play." TimesLIVE
