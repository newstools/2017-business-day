Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, two of his cabinet ministers and the head of the military met South African envoys on Thursday in his office, a day after the military seized power. Photos on the state Herald newspaper website showed Mugabe, Gen Constantine Chiwenga, Defence Minister Sydney Sekeramayi and State Security Minister Kembo Mohadi speaking with SA’s Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and State Security Minister Bongani Bongo, alongside Catholic priest Fidelis Mukonori. Mukonori has been the go-between in Mugabe’s talks with the armed forces. The details of their discussions were not released and sources emerged with conflicting information. One said Mugabe remained defiant, resisting a push from generals for him to step down, while another said the president had agreed to step down and only needed security assurances for him and his family.
