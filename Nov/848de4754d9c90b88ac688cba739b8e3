South African bonds were stable, along with the rand, on Tuesday morning, both still weighed down by the growing fear of credit rating downgrades for SA. The rand and bonds have been under continuous pressure from a series of events that have made it more likely that rating agencies could downgrade SA’s credit rating. Reports that power utility Eskom is on the brink of running out of cash to fund its operations, and the resignation of Michael Sachs as the Treasury’s deputy-director general in the budget office are the signs of erosion of SA’s institutions. Sasfin fixed income trader Alvin Chawasema said bonds reacted negatively to concern that the institutional strength that was once relied upon, was being eroded at an alarming pace, making it difficult to imagine rating agency S&P not lowering its local credit rating at the end of the month, while Moody’s could wait until after the ANC’s national executive conference in December. "Under these scenarios near-term risks to yields are heavily tilted towards the upside," said Chawasema. At 9.32am the bid on the R186 government bond was at unchanged at 9.47%. The rand was at R14.4792 to the dollar from R14.4767.
