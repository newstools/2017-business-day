South African bonds were steady on Thursday morning, tracking a stable rand as concern about local politics subsided. The rand has clawed back some of the losses seen earlier in the week — it weakened to R14.57/$ on Monday amid concern that ratings agencies would downgrade the country’s sovereign currency debt at the end of the month. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond peaked, along with the rand, reaching 9.47% on Monday, a level last reached in February 2016. Market focus will shift to international factors, with US jobless claims data due for release on Thursday. TreasuryOne dealer Andre Botha said the rand was likely to be range-bound as there was little on the local data diary, although "one headline can change the sentiment in a heartbeat". At 9.32am the benchmark R186 government bond was bid at 9.40% from 9.39% and the R207 was bid at 8.085% from 8.075%. The rand was little changed at R14.3911 to the dollar from R13.3944.
