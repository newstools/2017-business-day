Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown will miss Thursday’s deadline to put a new Eskom board in place, but her office says she is certain to make an announcement after next week’s Cabinet meeting. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba gave an undertaking in his "14 confidence-boosting measures", announced in July, that Eskom would have a new board in place by November 30. At the tabling of the medium-term budget policy statement, Treasury deputy director-general Anthony Julies said local banks had made the November 30 deadline for a new board a condition for rolling over existing loans. Brown’s spokesman, Colin Cruywagen, said on Monday that due to the postponement of this week’s Cabinet meeting to December 6, Brown would be unable to meet the deadline and would make the announcement next week instead. Cruywagen said the "process was complete" and Brown had finalised the list of Eskom directors to be put to the Cabinet. Several of the names put forward by Brown over the past month have been rejected by Cabinet colleagues as neither credible nor experienced enough to oversee Eskom. An Eskom default has been flagged as the single biggest risk to the economy. The company has total debt of R360bn, of which about R202bn is guaranteed by the government. The remainder — some R158bn — is unsecured debt in the form of loans from local banks and development finance institutions. While it still has about another R148bn of government guarantee facilities it could use, Eskom has found it increasingly difficult to borrow in the market because of growing evidence of widespread corruption.
