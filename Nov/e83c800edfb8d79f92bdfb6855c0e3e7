South African bonds were slightly firmer shortly before midday on Friday, despite the rand losing some ground to the dollar. The rand had earlier been slightly firmer to the greenback, which had been under pressure following news that special counsel Robert Mueller had requested Russia-related documents from more than a dozen officials from US President Donald Trump’s election campaign team. The dollar is, however, being buoyed by some progress on US tax reforms. The US House of Representatives approved the tax bill on Thursday‚ which aims to cut corporate taxes from 35% to 20%‚ among other things. The passage of a companion bill, that would lower corporate taxes to levels last seen in 1939, might be more difficult in the Senate, reported Dow Jones Newswires. Local bonds were firmer, having attracted some foreign demand on Thursday, which saw renewed interest for risk assets globally. Statistics for non-resident transactions corroborated the positive sentiment, while local accounts appeared to be more guarded, said Sasfin Securities bond analysts. At 11.30am, the bid on the R186 bond was at 9.32% from Thursday’s 9.35%, while the R207 was bid at 8.025% from 8.01%. The rand was at R14.2033 to the dollar from R14.1620.
