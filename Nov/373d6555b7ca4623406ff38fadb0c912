The rand was weaker against major global currencies on Friday morning, amid expected muted volumes and a resumption of Brexit talks in the UK. The dollar staged a mild recovery after coming under pressure recently due to doubts about the progress of US President Donald Trump’s tax reforms. The US Senate on Thursday proposed a delay to 2019, but various people, including Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, appeared unconcerned about it, said Oanda analyst Craig Erlam. Much focus would instead fall on the UK, which was due to release manufacturing data and continue Brexit negotiations with the EU, Erlam said. Locally, the ANC begins a national executive committee meeting at the weekend, and markets were likely to remain cautious, said Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking analysts. In the US, it is the Veterans Day holiday, and while markets were open, trading volumes were likely to be subdued, analysts said. At 9.30m‚ the rand was R14.2997 to the dollar from R14.2548‚ at R16.6432 to the euro from R16.5960 and at R18.7662 to the pound from R18.7435. The euro was at $1.1638 from $1.1642.
