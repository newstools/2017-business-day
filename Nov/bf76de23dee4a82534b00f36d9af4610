Nagpur — India’s captain and star batsman Virat Kohli will be rested for the one-day matches against Sri Lanka after the Test series ends, selectors said on Monday. Kohli has stepped up calls in recent weeks for a break because of the workload. India, the world’s top Test nation, start a demanding tour of SA in January. "I’m not a robot, you can slice my skin and check if I still bleed," Kohli said before the Sri Lanka series started. India beat Sri Lanka in the second Test that ended on Monday by an innings and 239 runs with Kohli named player of the match for his 213 in the first innings. He has played more international cricket in 2017 than any other Indian player — nine Tests, 26 one-day internationals and 10 Twenty20s. India will go into the third and final Test against Sri Lanka in New Delhi on Saturday with Kohli leading the squad. The return of batsman Shikhar Dhawan, who opted out of the second Test due to personal reasons, is the only change. The squad for the South African tour are to be named before the game starts. Kohli will be replaced as captain by batsman Rohit Sharma for the three-match one-day series after the Tests and is expected to remain captain for the T20 games too. Allrounder Hardik Pandya and fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who pulled out of the second and third Sri Lanka Tests to get married, return to the 15-man squad. The first of the three ODIs will be played in Dharamsala on December 10. AFP
