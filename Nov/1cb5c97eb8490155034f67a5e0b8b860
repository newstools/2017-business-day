President Jacob Zuma has postponed his visit to Zimbabwe until "further notice". On Tuesday, the Southern African Development Community (Sadc), which Zuma chairs, said Zuma and Angolan President Joao Lourenco, who chairs the Sadc organ on politics‚ defence and security co-operation‚ would go to Zimbabwe together. But the Presidency said Zuma "will no longer travel to Harare" on Wednesday. Robert Mugabe resigned as head of state on Tuesday. Zimbabweans in SA celebrated the development, though commentators warn that Mugabe’s exit, which did not come through democratic processes, will not necessarily lead to meaningful changes in politics in Zimbabwe. DA leader Mmusi Maimane tempered optimism with scepticism, calling the despot’s departure "the first step towards a new beginning for Zimbabwe" but warning that it was no silver bullet. "The story of Robert Mugabe is not a unique one‚ and is all too familiar on our continent. A once liberator of his people‚ Mugabe brought division‚ instability‚ and economic ruin to Zimbabwe as he made the unfortunate transition from liberator to dictator." He said the people of Zimbabwe must be given the opportunity to go to the polls and elect a new president. "The only way forward for Zimbabwe is for fresh elections to be held immediately." Expressing distrust of Zanu-PF, he said: "History has taught us that failed liberation movements cannot and will not self-correct. The solution has to come from outside these movements." The EFF welcomed Mugabe’s resignation but urged Zimbabwe not to capitulate on the land reform programme. EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said Zimbabweans should not "return the land to the white settler communities". "This is one legacy of President Mugabe that must be advanced and protected at all costs…. It is the obligation of all pan-Africanists to protect all the gains of decolonisation in Zimbabwe."
