State Security Minister Bongani Bongo claimed he was following instructions from acting Eskom board chairman Zethembe Khoza when he offered parliamentary inquiry evidence leader Advocate Ntuthuzelo Vanara a bribe to collapse the investigation into the capture of Eskom. This revelation is contained in an affidavit submitted by Vanara to parliamentary officials, which the Sunday Times has seen. The Sunday Times reported last week that Bongo had allegedly tried to bribe Vanara. Now shocking details have come to light in the affidavit, including that Bongo: • Relentlessly pursued Vanara with a blank cheque in exchange for him rendering the inquiry "dysfunctional" by resigning or "faking illness"; • Made phone calls almost daily to Vanara between October 4 and October 10, asking to meet; and • Wanted to know whether Vanara had scheduled any meetings with Khoza prior to his appearance before the inquiry.
