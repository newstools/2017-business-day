Sydney — Asian shares joined a global rally and scaled a fresh decade peak on Wednesday, as strong world growth and rising corporate profits lured hordes of investors into equities, while oil prices jumped on expectations of a production cut. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.6% to Wednesday’s 1.3% rise — the biggest gain in eight months, supported by energy and technology sectors. The index has been on an uptrend most of this year, posting a monthly loss only once in 2017. For the year, it is up about 33% so far, on track for its best annual performance since a 68% jump in 2009. Japan’s Nikkei was up 0.8% on Wednesday and South Korea’s KOSPI climbed 0.4%. Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index inched higher towards critical chart level of 6,000 points. A strengthening global economy this year has fed an insatiable appetite for equities, with Asia’s trade-dependent nations enjoying robust overseas sales in a boon to corporate earnings. "Emerging markets are flying," said Chris Weston, Melbourne-based chief markets strategist at IG. "Asia, in particular, is looking super strong. There is a genuine chase for performance from active money managers here." Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index is up 35.5% year-to-date while China’s CSI 300 has returned 27.4% so far in 2017. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq advanced to record closing highs on Tuesday, while the Dow set a new intraday high. Investors looking to eke out additional gains before the end of the year flocked to tech stocks, some fund managers said, with Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon.com rallying. While markets expect the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates next month, analysts say that is unlikely to damp equities as financial markets remain accommodative. The US Treasury yield curve flattened to its lowest in a decade as benign inflation and hunger for yield have supported longer-dated debt. Benchmark 10-year notes have inched higher to yield 2.3559%. The two-year Treasury, at 1.77%, is at the highest since 2008 and set to surpass Australia’s two-year government bond yields for the first time since December 2000. In currencies, the dollar was generally on the back foot against major rivals, falling for a second straight day against the yen. The Australian dollar was steady near $0.7576, putting a bit of distance between a five-month trough of $0.7532 plumbed overnight on dovish-sounding Reserve Bank of Australia policy meeting minutes. The euro trod water at $1.1741, drifting away from a recent one-month peak of $1.1860. In commodities, oil prices firmed after a reported fall in US crude inventories and on expectations that an Opec-led production cut aimed at tightening the market will be extended beyond March 2018. US light crude added 83c to $57.66 while Brent crude oil climbed 51c to $63.08, not far from a nearly two-and-a-half-year peak of $64.65 touched earlier this month. Copper futures extended gains for a fourth straight day, while spot gold was barely changed at $1,280.61. Reuters
