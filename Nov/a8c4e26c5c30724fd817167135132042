Sunday’s International Jockeys Challenge ended in a rare win for the visitors with nine-time Irish champion Pat Smullen leading his team to victory after some determined performances by himself and his fellow riders. Although it was a meeting to forget for SA captain Anthony Delpech, followers of the Business Day tips last Friday were rewarded with two good-priced winners in the international races — Smullen scoring on 7-1 chance Dromedaris and PJ Macdonald victorious on 8-1 shot Monarch Air. Jockey Gavin Lerena managed to win one of the international races for the home side and he travels to the Vaal on Tuesday. The pick of his quartet should be Geoff Woodruff’s No Mans Land in the seventh race. No Mans Land gets the vote to beat home Master Boulder and Truly who represents the in-form stable of Dorrie Sham. Lerena will be hoping that Celtic Lady can finally make it to the No1 box in the eighth race. But two females from the same yard, Osculation and Ilha Da Var, both have clear-cut chances and Mpumelelo Mjoka can go close on the first-named. Callan Murray partners Timed To Perfection, which has an each-way shout, with Paul Peter’s Bally Swiss also warranting inclusion in exotic perms. Murray’s best ride should be the Trippi colt Mawsoof in the sixth race. Torre Del Oro and Piere Strydom retain their partnership and the best way to bet on this 1,200m sprint may be to couple the four-year-old— also a son of Trippi — in the swinger with Mawsoof.
