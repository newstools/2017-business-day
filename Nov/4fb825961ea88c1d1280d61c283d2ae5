A former public works official will appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on Friday on charges of fraud‚ corruption and money laundering. Hawks spokesperson Capt S’fiso Nyakane said the official and four other people were arrested on Thursday morning following a lengthy inquiry into their dealings. The five suspects are alleged to have stolen more than R3m from the Department of Public Works by lodging fraudulent claims. "The official‚ who was stationed at the Bloemfontein regional office‚ and two of his former colleagues‚ who have since resigned‚ allegedly colluded with service providers in defrauding the department of an amount of R3.6m through submission of fraudulent claims for the payment of water and electricity between 2014 and 2015‚" said Nyakane. He said the five men were arrested at their homes in Bloemfontein and East London on Thursday morning. The Hawks’ investigation into the case continued and there could be more arrests, Nyakane said.
