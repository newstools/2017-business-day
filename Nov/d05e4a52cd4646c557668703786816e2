Mamelodi Sundowns forward Khama Billiat may have regained top form, but his future with the club remains cloudy. Billiat came off the bench in the 57th minute to score twice to consign Bidvest Wits to a 2-0 league defeat on Tuesday. In an earlier media conference‚ Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane said Billiat could stay if he wants or leave because his contract is expiring at the end of the season and the negotiations have reached a stalemate. Billiat said he still needed to speak to his agent to find out the exact status of his contract and his future with the club. "I don’t know if it has anything to do with my performance but my head is here and I’m still contracted to Sundowns and I have to honour my contract‚" he said. "I haven’t made up my mind yet but we are still talking. "I still want to play football until my contract expires. I just want to play football‚" Billiat said. TimesLIVE
