The rand was little changed on Wednesday morning, taking a breather after a surprise rally over the past two days. The local currency had advanced appreciably against the dollar and other currencies, catching many off guard, considering S&P Global Ratings downgraded SA’s rand-denominated debt to junk. The rand plays a key part in the outlook for inflation, which the Reserve Bank closely monitors to decide on interest rates. The battle for the leadership of the ruling ANC has emerged as one of the key factors driving the outsized gains in the rand. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and ANC MP Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma are tipped to be frontrunners to succeed President Jacob Zuma as party leader during the elective conference in December. A Ramphosa victory is seen as paving the way for the economic reforms that could boost business confidence, and so the rand gained over the past two days in line with perceptions that he is slightly ahead of Dlamini-Zuma. "The gains imply that the rand is now not only stronger than where it was before the downgrade but also even stronger than before the October budget," Rand Merchant Bank currency strategist John Cairns said in a note. "Our take remains that the rand gains are overdone. Yes, there does seem to be a clear shift in market thinking towards expecting a Ramaphosa win. But this is still far from a done deal." Markets were also keeping an eye on the global scene, where North Korea was back in focus after firing an intercontinental ballistic missile that looks like its most dangerous to date. But the global market reaction was so far muted, with traditional safe-haven assets little changed. Gold was relatively flat at $1,295.11 an ounce. At 8.46am‚ the rand was at R13.6667 to the dollar from R13.6645‚ at R16.2064 to the euro from R16.1801 and at R18.2867 to the pound from R18.2302. The euro was at $1.1859 from $1.1841.
