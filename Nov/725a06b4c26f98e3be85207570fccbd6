DA leader Mmusi Maimane has been given permission to view President Jacob Zuma’s declaration of interests which he will do at the Union Building on Monday. Maimane submitted a request to view the declaration of interests last week and the director-general in the Presidency, Cassius Lubisi, has agreed to this. "I will be viewing the president’s declaration of interests documents for all the years of his presidency, with a particular eye on whether he declared the R1m per year salary he received from his friend and tender mogul, Roy Moodley’s company, Royal Security, during the first few months of this presidency," Maimane said in a statement. Allegations that Zuma was paid a salary by Royal Security were made in the recently released controversial book by Jacques Pauw called The President’s Keepers. Zuma denied during question time in the National Assembly last week that he had received payments from private individuals or companies during his tenure as president "other than those which have been disclosed or reported to the necessary authorities". Maimane said it was vital to confirm that Zuma had, in fact, declared the salary, and that he paid the appropriate tax in terms of the Income Tax Act. "If the R1m per month salary has not been declared as required by the Executive Ethics Act, the DA will consider what further action is appropriate in the circumstances," he added. "President Zuma is subject to the law as like any other citizen, and we will ensure he is treated as such." Maimane noted that the president’s declaration of interests was a public document under the Executive Ethics Act. The code of ethics states: "Any person has access to the public part of a register during office hours of the secretary concerned."
