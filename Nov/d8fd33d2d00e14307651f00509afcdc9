Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown came under scathing attack on Tuesday from an Eskom GM, who accused her of being incompetent, a liar and captured by the Guptas. The accusations came as the Department of Public Enterprises criticised the inquiry into state capture taking place in Parliament and led by the committee for public enterprises for being "procedurally unfair". It alleged that evidence leader Nthuthuzelo Vanara had allowed statements to be made about people without them being given an opportunity to respond. This was the case, the department said, with the allegation that Deputy Minister of Public Enterprises Ben Martins had attended a meeting earlier in 2017 with Ajay Gupta, Gupta associate Salim Essa and suspended Eskom head of legal and compliance Suzanne Daniels. Martins has denied he had been present at the meeting and Eskom has distanced itself from the statements made by Daniels and its reputation manager and GM in the chairman’s office, Khulani Qoma.
