Singapore — Oil markets were stable on Thursday as rising US crude production and inventories were countered by the expectation that Opec will extend a production cut during a meeting at the end of this month. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $61.98 a barrel at 4.38am GMT, 11c above their last close. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $55.37 a barrel, 4c up from their last settlement. "Oil shrugged off an unexpected rise in the US crude inventory data.… Both contracts eked out small gains," said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. Despite these slight gains, Brent and WTI have lost about 4% in value since hitting 2015 highs last week, pulled down in part by rising crude availability in the US. US crude inventories rose for a second week in a row, building by 1.9-million barrels in the week to November 10 to 459-million barrels, the government’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday. That compared with analyst expectations in a Reuters poll for a decrease of 2.2-million barrels. US crude oil production hit a record of 9.65-million barrels a day, meaning output has risen by almost 15% since their most recent low in mid-2016. Despite this, analysts said prices were relatively well supported due to efforts led by oil cartel Opec to withhold oil production in order to tighten the market and prop up prices. The deal is due to expire in March 2018, but Opec will meet on November 30 to discuss policy, and it is expected to agree an extension of the cuts. "Opec, led by Saudi … will look to support the market, especially until the sale of Aramco is complete. If sanctions against Iran are executed, it will drive the price significantly higher," said Shane Chanel, equities and derivatives adviser at ASR Wealth Advisers in Sydney. Reuters
