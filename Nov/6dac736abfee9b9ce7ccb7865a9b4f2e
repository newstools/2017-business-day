Bengaluru — Gold prices were little changed on Thursday after upbeat US economic data bolstered the prospect of interest rate increases next month and beyond by the Federal Reserve. Spot gold was nearly unchanged at $1,278.55/oz at 3.54am GMT. On Wednesday, gold touched a session high of $1,289.09, a peak since October 20, before paring gains and ending the session about 0.2% lower due to a stronger dollar. US gold futures for December delivery gained 0.1% $1,277.80. "It [gold’s range-bound movement] is a combination of Fed rate hike [expectations] and equity market volatility. There are increasing risks in the market now," said Argonaut Securities analyst Helen Lau. "Views around these two countering forces could keep gold flat in the short-term," she added. Higher interest rates tend to boost the dollar and push bond yields up, putting pressure on gold prices by increasing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. Underlying US consumer prices increased in October, strengthening the view that a recent disinflationary trend worrying the Fed probably had ended. Falling unemployment and sustained growth meant the US economy had accelerated beyond a sustainable level so the Fed should continue to raise interest rates, including next month, veteran Fed policy maker Eric Rosengren said on Wednesday. Spot gold remained neutral in a range of $1,270/oz-$1,286/oz, and an escape could suggest a direction, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. "It is perhaps best to remain sidelined for now, as the gold complex seems to be trapped within a relatively tight trading range and has yet to assert a meaningful direction," INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir said in a note. Asian shares got off to a cautious start on Thursday after Wall Street stumbled despite upbeat US economic news and the treasury yield curve hit its flattest in a decade. The dollar index, which tracks the US currency against a basket of six major rivals, edged up 0.1%. In other precious metals, palladium was flat at $984.22/oz. On Wednesday, it touched a low of $973.40, a bottom since October 31, and fell for the fifth consecutive session. Platinum was down 0.1% at $930/oz. Silver was unchanged at $16.99/oz. Reuters
