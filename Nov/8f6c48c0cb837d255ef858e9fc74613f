The JSE opened flat on Wednesday as the rand recorded renewed gains against the dollar, despite reports that President Jacob Zuma had warned that the ANC conference in December might collapse. Retailers reversed Tuesday’s gains on profit-taking, while property stocks with a focus on the local market retreated. The market is pricing in a leadership victory by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa at the conference, but analysts have warned that it is far from a foregone conclusion. The rand firmed to R13.5764/$ from R13.6645/$, and seems set to strengthen further with Zuma’s warnings indicating that his supporters could be on the back foot. Trading on the JSE this week has been choppy on the surprise movements in the rand following S&P Global Ratings’ downgrade on Friday. "SA Inc counters were in demand post the rating decision by Moody’s to only put us on review until February, while banking and general retailer indices were up for the second day in a row as resources slid on a stronger rand," analysts at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking said. Global market sentiment was upbeat following the Dow’s closure at a record high on Tuesday, as optimism grew over US tax cuts and the central bank’s interest-rate policy. The dollar made some comeback against the euro after US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said at his confirmation hearing that he would back an interest rate rise in December, which is already largely priced into the market.
