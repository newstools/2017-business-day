Trainer Dennis Bosch, one of the most colourful characters in racing, has received an early Christmas gift with his patron Alesh Naidoo buying the top lot for R1.1m at the Lanzerac CTS Ready-To-Run Sale at Durbanville in Cape Town. Bosch, a former jockey who has made a successful transition to the training ranks, will train the Dynasty colt out of All Is Secret who was consigned by Klawervlei Stud as agent. At the well attended sale the aggregate reached R30.48m, marginally ahead of the 2016 sale when 15 additional lots were sold. With 129 lots of the 149 in the catalogue sold, Cape Thoroughbred Sales will be happy with the healthy average of R236,279. Klawervlei Stud enjoyed a good sale with an aggregate of R6.2m; its 20 lots sold averaging R314,250. Normandy Stud also returned an almost identical aggregate for its 23 lots sold. The second-highest price at the sale was R850,000 for a Var colt consigned by Drakenstein Stud. The youngster was signed for by Mark Erasmus. The next highest price was R800,000, a bid by David Abery to secure a daughter of the recently deceased stallion Captain Al. Another of the same sire’s progeny was purchased for R600,000 by Chris van Niekerk’s Rainbow Beach Trading and will join the stable of champion trainer Sean Tarry. Jackson, a son of Dynasty whose six wins included three grade1 victories, was represented by an attractive colt who caught the eye of Heywood Bloodstock. It purchased the two-year-old for R700,000.
