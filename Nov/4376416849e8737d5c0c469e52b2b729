London — Oil markets stabilised on Thursday as the expectation that oil cartel Opec would extend production limits balanced rising US crude production and inventories. Brent crude oil was up 20c a barrel at $62.07 by 8.30am GMT. US light crude was 10c higher at $55.43 a barrel. Global oil markets are looking ahead to a meeting of Opec in Vienna on November 30, which is expected to decide to extend limits on crude production to help tighten supply. Opec and other big producers including Russia agreed a year ago to cut crude output by 1.8-million barrels a day to try to bolster prices. That deal is due to expire at the end of March 2018 but ministers have signalled that they are likely to extend the agreement, possibly until the end of next year. "Opec, led by Saudi … will look to support the market," said Shane Chanel, equities and derivatives adviser at ASR Wealth Advisers. Oil prices have risen steadily over the past few months as the impact of supply cuts has drained inventories. Both crude benchmarks hit two-year highs last week. Prices have slipped back in recent days, partly due to evidence that supply from the US is rising fast, hampering Opec’s efforts to tighten the market. On Wednesday, the US government’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) said domestic crude inventories rose for a second week in a row, building by 1.9-million barrels in the week to November 10 to 459-million barrels. Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected a decrease of 2.2-million barrels. US crude oil production has hit a record of 9.65-million barrels a day, meaning output has risen by almost 15% since their most recent low in mid-2016. Reuters
