The rand crept weaker on Friday morning, but held within its recent range, just hours before Moody’s and SP Global Ratings deliver their long-awaited reviews on SA’s debt rating. It remains unclear whether the two agencies will downgrade SA’s crucial rand-denominated debt and, more importantly, how the markets will react to the decision. The rand and local bonds could be the immediate casualties if the two rating companies pull the trigger on the local-currency debt rating. By some accounts, billions of rand could flow out of local bond market. But some argue that the markets, which tend to be forward looking, have positioned themselves according to that probability. The rand and local bonds weakened substantially in the days following the medium-term budget policy statement, which analysts said had veered off fiscal consolidation, thus increasing the chance of a ratings downgrade. Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, said Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba needed to present a credible and solid medium-term budget, but had failed to do so. "As such, we believe the deteriorating fiscal outlook will lead to rating downgrades this month," Thin said in a note. The uncertainty over how the ratings agencies will proceed on Friday evening and the market reaction thereof persuaded the Reserve Bank to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday. Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago also cited the ANC’s elective conference in December as another event that posed risk to the rand and, by implication, inflation. The ruling party will elect a new leader to replace President Jacob Zuma, whose term in office has been mired in controversy. At 8.54am, the rand was at R13.9269 to the dollar from R13.8807, at R16.4982 to the euro from R16.4516 and at R18.5046 to the pound from R18.4780. The euro was at $1.1848 from $1.1851.
