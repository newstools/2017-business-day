The Blitzboks are working to reach new standards as they go into the new season with a huge target on their backs after dominating the 2016-17 HSBC World Sevens Series. After capturing the overall title last season by winning five of the 10 tournaments and making three more finals‚ the challenges for the coming season are three-pronged. There is the World Series title to defend while the Blitzboks will also have to defend their Commonwealth Games crown in Australia in April 2018‚ which they won in 2014. There is also the small matter of the Sevens World Cup in San Francisco next July. "We haven’t finalised our goals for the season, but it’s going to be a tough balance‚" coach Neil Powell said. "Of course, we want to win all three events but the requirements are different. "Because we will play more Academy players at some World Series events, it’s possible we’ll sacrifice some of that consistency and perhaps success over the course of the season. "The priority is probably going to be on retaining the Commonwealth Games gold medal and winning the World Cup. We have never won the World Cup at sevens‚ which makes it a priority." TimesLIVE
