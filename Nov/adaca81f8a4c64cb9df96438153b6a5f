The JSE opened firmer on Friday, as Naspers surged for the fifth successive session and gold stocks rose on the weaker dollar. Naspers was up more than 2% after Chinese internet company Tencent, of which it owns about at third, rocketed nearly 3% in Hong Kong trade following better than expected results in the third quarter released earlier in the week. The rand was steady at R14.1950 to the dollar on a weaker dollar. The greenback lost ground against the euro following a report that special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators have issued a subpoena to more than 12 officials in the Trump election campaign for documents related to Russia. Analysts at FxPro said this was the first instance of Mueller ordering the Trump Administration to hand over information. "The news saw the dollar coming under pressure as Trump could ill-afford any more criticism of his leadership or that Russia played a part in his election victory," FxPro said. Earlier, the dollar firmed after the House of Representatives passed a $1.5-trillion tax overhaul through the House on Thursday. Local banks showed little reaction to the rand, but retailers were firmer.
