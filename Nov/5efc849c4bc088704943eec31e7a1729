A hybrid model involving the Department of Home Affairs, the banks and the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) in the distribution of social grants, is under consideration, Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe says. He told Parliament’s joint meeting of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts and the portfolio committee on social development that a series of protocols were drafted and signed on Friday, to plan for distribution of grants in 2018. Radebe spoke after a briefing last week where he said a roadmap for the provision of grants would be supplied to Parliament. "The meeting with the financial institutions and the Banking Council of SA on November 10 agreed on the principle of establishing a special affordable account for Sassa beneficiaries and how to enhance their role in Sassa grants. The parties agreed to further meetings to discuss details of the commercial accounts and the expansion of their joint activities," he said. He said last Friday that Sassa and the South African Post Office (Sapo) had signed an implementation protocol that was an overarching implementation agreement in terms of the Intergovernmental Relations Framework Act. "The collaboration between Sassa and Sapo is further enabled by section 238 b of the Constitution, section 4 (2) (b) and the South African Social Security Act, which allows Sassa to do anything necessary for the realisation of the agency’s objectives and the National Integrated ICT policy White Paper," said Radebe. Radebe said the parties would submit a detailed project plan to the interministerial committee on December 6, and to the panel of experts assembled by the Constitutional Court by December 8.
