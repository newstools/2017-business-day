While many of us dream of being astronauts or visiting space, few would imagine leaving Earth to inhabit a new planet millions of kilometres away. For one remarkable South African, however, the thought of undertaking the great trek to new planets is what makes her get up in the morning. The leading minds of our time, including such luminaries as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, believe our long-term survival as a species relies on our ability to inhabit other planets. In 2012, the Mars One mission was announced, a private mission to establish a permanent human colony on the Red Planet by 2025. As one of the final candidates for this historic initiative, South African innovator, academic and aspiring Martian Dr Adriana Marais is a leading local voice for humankind’s aspirations to colonise another planet. Asked about the obvious difficulty in travelling to and inhabiting a place as distant as Mars, she fondly remembers one of Nelson Mandela's most famous quotes: “It always seems impossible until it’s done.” “I believe what’s most important during this short time we have on Earth is to represent an idea that is greater than just your lifetime,” says Marais. “While there’s only a small group of people set to embark on the first manned mission to Mars, its success is something in which all of humanity will share.” Marais shares her remarkable story as the first guest on the Blue Couch Sessions, a new web series celebrating remarkable South Africans from all walks of life.
