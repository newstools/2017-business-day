The JSE opened firmer on Thursday on a renewed rally in Naspers as Asian markets shrugged off a weaker close on the Dow. Concern about US markets, based on stalled US tax reform plans, lifted on the optimism that global growth could be as high as 4% in 2018. Global markets are experiencing rational exuberance, Barclays Research analysts said. Barclays said the global expansion remained broad-based and in good health. The US was the upside surprise in the third quarter, but the eurozone, Japan and China were all growing at or above consensus. "The synchronised upswing is creating a virtuous circle, with strong global demand boosting US trade and inventories," Barclays said, adding that growth in 2018 could even top 4% if the US enacted significant tax reform. Naspers gained nearly 2% and was in record territory for the second consecutive session on upbeat third-quarter numbers from Chinese internet company Tencent, of which it owns about a third. The Dow closed 0.59% lower at 23,271.28 points. Energy and technology shares were under pressure on the weaker oil price. General Electric bounced back after falling 13% in the previous two sessions.

Industrials added 0.86%, resources 0.77%, food and drug retailers 0.73% and platinum 0.53%. The gold index lost 1.05% and general retailers 0.39%.
