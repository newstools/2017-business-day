Ingenuity Property said on November 2 that it expected to report on Friday that headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the year to end-August declined by 83%. Ingenuity said this was due to finance charges increasing by R50.5m, partly due to entering into interest swap contracts. "The positive factor resulting from the swaps is that the company has now hedged 72% of its total borrowings for periods expiring between November 2020 and August 2022, at an all-in weighted average rate as at August 31 2017 of 9.62%," the trading statement said.
