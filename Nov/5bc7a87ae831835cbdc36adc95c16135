The rand was softer against major global currencies shortly before midday on Friday, but was relatively range-bound as the markets waited for Moody’s and SP Global Ratings to deliver their long-awaited determinations on SA’s creditworthiness. The agencies are widely expected to leave SA’s local currency ratings where they are for now, but should this not be the case "Black Friday might spill into the currency market and we will be in for an interesting time", said TreasuryOne dealer Gerard van der Westhuizen. Analysts maintain that the market has already partially priced in a downgrade, but say the agencies may wait until next year, when there is greater clarity on the economic policy priorities of the ANC. Volumes are also expected to be somewhat subdued, with it being only a half-day for markets in the US. The rand had barely moved on Thursday, despite the Reserve Bank adopting a hawkish tone. Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago cited, among other things, risks to the rand and policy uncertainty for the expectation that rates would rise a total of 75 basis points by the end of 2019. As always, this policy trajectory was not set in stone, Kganyago said. At 11.30am, the rand was at R13.9462 to the dollar from R13.8807, at R16.5459 to the euro from R16.4516, and at R18.5759 to the pound from R18.4780. The euro was at $1.1864 from $1.1851.
