Winning the Caf Confederation Cup would be the perfect consolation for SuperSport United striker Jeremy Brockie after the New Zealander missed out on qualification for the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia. The wounds of New Zealand’s 2-0 aggregate World Cup defeat to Peru are still fresh and Brockie said he hoped that Saturday’s Caf Confederation Cup final second leg against TP Mazembe would help him forget about the heartbreak. "I was probably lucky enough that the TP Mazembe game came soon after our loss in Peru‚" he said. "It did not give me enough time to reflect and think about missing out on the World Cup too much." Brockie said it would be the proudest moment of his club career if United were able to overcome the 2-1 first leg deficit and beat TP Mazembe. "In terms of club career‚ winning this tournament would be right there at the top‚" he said. "The only thing higher from a club point of view is winning the Champions League and going to the Fifa Club World Cup. "We are close to it and we don’t want to give it away." Brockie goes into the second leg as top scorer in the series, with 10 goals to his name and he is almost assured of walking away with the golden boot, as Ben Malango of TP Mazembe is sitting on six goals.
