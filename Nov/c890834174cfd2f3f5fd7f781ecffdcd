The annual change in CPI is the key measure of inflation used by the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee to set interest rates. The central bank’s governor and chair of the monetary policy committee, Lesetja Kganyago, will announce whether there is to be any change to interest rates at 3pm on Thursday. Investec Bank economist Kamilla Kaplan forecasts the annual change in CPI will have slowed to 4.9% in October from 5.1% in September, strengthening the case for the central bank to hold its repo rate at 6.75%. South African commercial banks by convention add 3.5 percentage points to the central bank’s repo rate, meaning they are likely to hold their prime rate at 10.25% on Thursday. "In October, the contribution from the fuel price component [to CPI inflation] is expected to have decreased as petrol and diesel prices rose by 4c and 23c a litre respectively, compared with an increase of 29c and 41c a litre in September," Kaplan said in note on Friday. "The October CPI update is also expected to reflect a continued moderation in food price inflation, which fell to 5.4% in September from double digit growth in 2016 and the first quarter of 2017."
