Specialist financial service company Ecsponent on Tuesday reported a 72.2% rise in headline earnings per share (HEPS) to 1.7c for the six-months to end-September. Total profits after tax increased by 77.4% to R31m during the period, compared with R17.5m in the prior period, which ran until the end of June, the company said in a statement. External revenue generated by the group’s Business Credit operations increased by 56.4% to R142.2m – 87% of total revenue. Total assets increased by 124%, from R635m to R1.425bn, compared with the comparative period. As a result, operating profit was up 107.5%, from R55m to R114m. During the period, Ecsponent began its expansion to include listed equities, with its first investment a 9.4% stake in Frankfurt-listed MyBucks. This investment had the advantage of providing a rand hedge. Ecsponent, which is funded primarily by high-yielding preference shares, declared no ordinary dividend. However, preference share dividends, and interest of R77.3m, accrued to investors across the company’s six share classes. This compares with the R86m paid in the 15 months to end-March. At 9.51am Ecsponent’s share price was up 2.78% to 37c, having gained 164.29% so far in 2017. An earlier version of this article erroneously stated Ecsponent's share price at the time.
