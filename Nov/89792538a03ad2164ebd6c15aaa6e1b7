The JSE opened firmer on Monday, holding above the 60,000-point level, as market heavyweight Naspers headed for R4,000 a share, after rocketing 8.6% last week. Naspers said on Friday in a trading statement that interim headline earnings per share (HEPS) to end-September were expected to be between 62% and 67% higher than a year ago. This followed higher than expected numbers from Chinese internet company Tencent, of which Naspers owns about a third. Naspers is set to release its interims on November 29. The positive sentiment surrounding Naspers, and a slightly weaker rand, supported some rand hedges. Resources were weaker, despite firmer commodity prices, including copper and zinc. Platinums gained on a weaker metal price. The Dow closed 0.43% lower on Friday, the second consecutive week of losses. Stronger Chinese bourses supported market sentiment on Monday, with the Hong Kong Hang Seng gaining 0.23%. The Nikkei was 0.6% lower, while the dollar regained some lost ground against the euro. The initial failure of talks in Germany to form a new coalition government, made up of centre-right parties and left-leaning environmentalists, sent the euro sliding, Dow Jones Newswires reported. It helped to push up the safe-haven yen and put pressure on Japanese stocks, which last week logged their first weekly decline since early September, the newswires said. At 9.30am the all share was up 0.26% to 60,287.50 points and the blue-chip top 40 added 0.28%. Industrials rose 0.72%, platinums 0.63%, and food and drug retailers 0.53%.

Astral Foods was 1.12% off at R198.22. Annual gross profit was up 37.5% to end-September, but the group said future prospects remained dim due to a weak economy. Netcare dropped 2.87% to R22.34.
