Piet Nel from the South African Institute of Tax Professionals discusses whether a tax revolt may be brewing in SA. The medium-term budget has been widely criticised, with tax revenue falling short by R50.8bn. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba says the shortfall is due to the slow-growing economy. South Africans are fed up, facing an increase in tax rates, and according to Nel we are already experiencing some push-back through money moving abroad, illicit cash flows and shifting profit.
