Mia Kruger of wealth manager Kruger International picks EOH, down 1.05% at R95. A darling of the South African market up until the past 18 months, there has been a substantial slide in the share price which she says is due to unfounded negative news. EOH's recent results showed that two-thirds of their growth was done organically, addressing one of the market's main concerns. Jean Pierre Verster of Fairtree Capital chose Facebook - down 0.16% at $178,48 - as his stock pick of the day. What makes it so positive and so powerful is that it's one of the strongest networks in the world, it's a social network but more and more it's becoming a financial network, he says - a resilient business that is growing strongly. They are also going into artificial intelligence and virtual reality (VR), and even though it's shot up more than 40% just about every year, Verster says he still sees value, even at these levels.
