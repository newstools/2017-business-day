Eskom’s Matshela Koko might get off lightly as key witnesses decline to testify. The power utility has in the meantime set aside the case against McKinsey. Strange bedfellows? Tim Cohen says the irony in the MultiChoice-ANN7 saga is that DStv is part of the Naspers empire, headed by Koos Bekker, while ANN7 supports the campaign against another member of the so-called Stellenbosch mafia, the Rupert family. It’s a deal that South African citizens were not meant to know about. Perhaps it explains a thing or two about Naspers’s success in working under the Nats and in China. Meanwhile, the JSE-listed holding company of TV channels eNCA and e.tv reported a loss as MultiChoice halved the licence due to eNCA from to R140.8m from R266.6m. Slight uptick at Liberty but analysts would like to see a clear strategy.
