Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela has not ruled out the possibility of dipping into the transfer market for a more clinical finisher in the January window after his players spurned opportunities in the Telkom Knockout defeat to Wits on Saturday. Dumisani Zuma and Gustavo Paez were the main culprits in the 1-0 semifinal loss. "Listen‚ strikers are strikers‚" said Komphela after a defeat that left him with the Premiership and the Nedbank Cup as the only titles he can still fight for this season. "We could have had the best striker on the day‚ but if it’s not your day‚ it’s not. Missing chances like these [the ones missed by Paez and Zuma]‚ happens. But if you ask me ‘if there is an opportunity for us to get another striker’‚ yes there is. With Zuma and Paez I thought we could at least have got an equaliser," the coach said. "Zuma had one-on-one twice. Peaz as well had his fair share. All these are excuses and excuses. But if you ask ‘did we have an opportunity to equalise’‚ yes we did." Komphela was ultimately punished for starting the match with Bernard Parker as a lone striker‚ hoping to catch Wits on a counter. The Chiefs coach also had Joseph Molangoane and Philani Zulu earmarked for attacks on the flanks, but both found themselves deep in their own half most of the time in the first half. What also did not help Chiefs was Komphela’s decision to start with three central defenders‚ Eric Mathoho‚ Siyabonga Ngezana and Daniel Cardoso‚ who he eventually withdrew for Paez at the start of the second half. Wits were tactically superior enough in the first half where they denied Chiefs space and movement and got the winner through James Keene’s header in the 28th minute. The Wits goal came straight after Chiefs midfielder Wiseman Meyiwa was shown a red card for what looked like a soft landing on Daine Klate. TimesLIVE
