South African government bonds were firmer on Tuesday morning, continuing with the rally seen on Monday. The benchmark R186 government bond started the morning session slightly weaker but strengthened, like the rand, just after the market opened. The rand closed 2.81% firmer at R13.76/$ on Monday despite Friday night’s downgrade to junk status by S&P Global Ratings. Moody’s put SA on review for a downgrade next year, citing weak economic growth prospects and a deterioration in public finances. As the market digested the news of the downgrade, it received support from reports that the Presidency had directed the National Treasury’s fiscal committee to find measures to address the roughly R40bn revenue gap that Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba had said in his medium-term budget policy statement was needed to stabilise public debt at a level of below 60% of GDP. Sasfin fixed-income analysts said the ball was now in the Treasury’s court and economic growth would need to be substantively addressed before Moody’s completed its 90-day review process. At 9.30am the R186 government bond was bid at 9.195% from Monday’s 9.215%, while the R207 was bid at 7.945% from 7.970%. The rand was at R13.7252 to the dollar from R13.7563.
