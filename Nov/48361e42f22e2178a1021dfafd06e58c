The ANC Free State provincial conference will not take place this weekend after all. On Wednesday the High Court in Bloemfontein ordered the conference not to be held until 29 branch general meetings, which the court declared unlawful and irregular, are conducted in a lawful manner.  Hanno Bekker, attorney for the 26 ANC members who brought the case, said there had to be seven days’ notice given before a branch general meeting could be held. There was thus not enough time to convene these meetings, Bekker said. The court's decision comes a day after the Free State provincial general council was held in Parys, where Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma was nominated as the province’s presidential candidate. The Free State provincial executive committee’s term ended in May this year. The provincial conference was recently ordered by the court to take place this weekend.
