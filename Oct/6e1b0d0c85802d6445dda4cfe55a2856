The JSE all share opened flat on Tuesday as the market consolidated above the 58,000 level amid mixed Asian markets after the Dow closed at yet another record high on Monday. Lower commodity prices and a stable rand kept a lid on gains among the miners. Spot gold lost 0.37% to $1,290.10/oz. Retailers were flat on upbeat interim results from Pick n Pay while the property index marginally gained on advances from market heavyweight Nepi Rockcastle. The rand was at R13.3368 to the dollar from R13.3274. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.37% higher on Monday, within a whisker of the record 23,000-point level, as optimism about tax reforms and corporate earnings supported sentiment. The Nikkei 225 was up 0.38% and the Hang Seng 0.05%. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in an early morning note that the positive mood in emerging markets was likely to be reinforced during the upcoming IMF meetings, but the rand remained vulnerable to higher US rates. It said robust global financial conditions presented upside risk to 2018 growth forecasts. In the absence of significant financial tightening, the hawkish shift in monetary policy was likely to continue. "A longer-term concern is that today’s stimulative financial conditions could be tomorrow’s vulnerability," Bank of America Merrill Lynch said. At 9.28am the all share was 0.10% lower at 58,107.10 points and the blue-chip top 40 down 0.07%. The gold index shed 1.72%, platinum 0.67%, resources 0.30%, and food and drug retailers 0.19%.
