Overseas travel by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s wife Norma to accompany her husband to international events has already cost the state more than R500,000 so far this year. Norma Gigaba accompanied her husband to the US for the Spring events of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, as well as to the Brics conference and meeting of central bank governors in Shanghai in June; the African investor conference in London in June; and the Group of 20 (G20) conference in Germany in July. Gigaba provided this information in a written reply to a parliamentary question by DA finance spokesman David Maynier. Gigaba’s spokesman, Mayihlome Tshwete, has justified the fact that Gigaba’s wife accompanies him to international events on the basis that this is allowed in terms of the ministerial handbook and gives them an opportunity to be together in the minister’s hectic schedule. Commenting on the reply, Maynier said Gigaba should be setting an example when it comes to belt-tightening, especially as he was the person responsible for implementing cost containment measures across the government. He noted that Norma Gigaba had had no official role during the minister’s official visits. “What this means is that, assuming the current rate of travel, taxpayers will blow R2.25m on Norma Gigaba’s international travel by the next election in 2019,” Maynier said. “The fact is that, even if all the expenses were in line with the ministerial handbook, it is simply wrong, especially when 30.4-million people live in poverty and battle to put bread on the table.” Maynier said he would propose amendments to the guidelines regulating official international travel as they apply to Cabinet ministers. © Business Day
