Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has given the board of the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) and its CEO, Dan Matjila, two weeks to give him a list of all the PIC’s beneficiaries and investments. The Treasury said on Friday that the list would be made public, and that Gigaba had called for a forensic investigation into any concerns about irregularities at the asset manager. The minister expects the list to detail the directors and shareholders of the companies in which the PIC is invested, to ensure transparency and build confidence in the PIC, which looks after public sector workers’ pension funds. Gigaba said: "We need to assure pension holders that those with political or economic power will not be allowed to unduly influence the PIC." He said he would consider demands from labour to sit on the PIC board. Unions made the demand this week, saying it was provided for in the PIC Act. The Treasury’s statement on Friday morning said the minister was concerned about the "politicising" of the PIC. DA finance spokesman David Maynier said the minister's claims of “bold action” to protect the integrity of the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) was a case of playing catch up. Gigaba he said was "desperately trying to claim ownership of processes that are already underway at the PIC". He noted that the first disclosure of beneficiaries and investments, which included details of directors and shareholders, was made in 2016, and that work towards preparing the second disclosure was under way at the PIC. Maynier said the PIC chairperson had already agreed to consider an investigation into irregularities, including the recent smear campaign, which did so much damage to the PIC.
