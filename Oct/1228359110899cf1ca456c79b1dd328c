After 12 months of development and six months of beta testing, eazi.com – South Africa’s first property marketplace – officially launched on September 1 2017. “Our primary goal is to make buying and selling your home easier while increasing the value of your investment,” CEO Shaun Minnie explains. “The South African property landscape has fundamentally changed in the last few years,” says Minnie. “Information that used to be available only to estate agents is now available to buyers and sellers. In addition, technology is making the process much more efficient. We believe this must translate into tangible benefits for the transacting parties.” “We are fundamentally improving the way in which homes are bought and sold. Our proprietary technology allows buyers and sellers to transact in an informed and transparent yet secure manner – something completely new to the residential property market,” says Minnie. “We include everything you would expect from a traditional estate agent, as well as a whole lot more.” The “whole lot more” refers to a range of unique features that benefit both sellers and buyers. “We don’t believe your investment should be diluted by commission,” says Minnie. Customers pay a one-off transaction fee of R29,500 only on the successful sale of their property. For now, eazi.com is focused on Cape Town, but it has plans to launch in other major cities over the next few months. Find out more at www.eazi.com. This article was paid for by eazi.com.
