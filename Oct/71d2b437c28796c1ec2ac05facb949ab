KPMG, which has been left reeling by its involvement with the Guptas and the South African Revenue Service (SARS), is this week set to announce the panellists who will conduct an independent investigation into the audit firmâ€™s conduct. KPMG is also expected to give details about the scope, terms of reference and the estimated duration of the probe. New KPMG SA CEO Nhlamu Dlomu, who inherited a mess left by her predecessors, said the inquiry would be fully independent and the panel would be led by two experienced senior counsel. The findings of the independent inquiry would be made public. KPMG, one of the big four audit firms, is in the fight of its life as clients have jumped ship, while its reputation has been battered by its involvement with the Guptas and SARS. Global consultancy firm McKinsey is also under pressure for its role in facilitating corruption at Eskom in collaboration with the Gupta-associated Trillian. Last week Eskom said it had taken steps to recover money paid to McKinsey and Trillian. The High Court in Pretoria is set to hand down judgment in the matter involving the bank accounts of Gupta-owned companies. The companies were given a reprieve in September, when the closure of their Bank of Baroda accounts was postponed. The Bank of Baroda was to pull the plug on the business and loan accounts of the 20 companies on September 30. The companies approached the High Court in Pretoria to have the main application, meant to be heard in December interdicting the bank from closing their accounts, heard before the deadline for the closure of the accounts. The Bank of Baroda was the last bank to continue offering services to the Guptas following the decision by the big banks to cut ties with the family.
